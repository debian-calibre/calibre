  Class PictureFlow implements an image show widget with animation effect

  of slides, one main slide is shown at the center with few slides on 
  the left and right sides of the center slide. When the next or previous 
  slide is brought to the front, the whole slides flow to the right or 
  the right with smooth animation effect; until the new slide is finally 
  placed at the center.
