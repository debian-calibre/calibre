 * property list for object 0xFFFFFFFF with parameter 3 likewise
 * set to 0xFFFFFFFF. Compare to
 * DEVICE_FLAG_BROKEN_MTPGETOBJECTPROPLIST which only signify
 * that it's broken when getting metadata for a SINGLE object.
 * A typical way the implementation may be broken is that it
 * may not return a proper count of the objects, and sometimes
 * (like on the ZENs) objects are simply missing from the list
 * if you use this. Sometimes it has been used incorrectly to
 * mask bugs in the code (like handling transactions of data
 * with size given to -1 (0xFFFFFFFFU), in that case please
 * help us remove it now the code is fixed. Sometimes this is
 * used because getting all the objects is just too slow and
 * the USB transaction will time out if you use this command.

 * mass storage interface is in use, other apps (like our
 * userspace libmtp through libusb access path) cannot get in

 * exactly one extra byte is sent at the end of the transfer
 * if the size is an integer multiple of USB 1.1 endpoint size
 * (64 bytes).
 *
 * This behaviour is most probably a workaround due to the fact
 * that the hardware USB slave controller in the device cannot
 * handle zero writes at all, and the usage of the USB 1.1
 * endpoint size is due to the fact that the device will "gear
 * down" on a USB 1.1 hub, and since 64 bytes is a multiple of

 * while firmware bugs should be fixed in firmware, we like
 * OGG so much that we back it by introducing this flag.
 * The error has only been seen on iriver devices. Turning this
 * flag on won't hurt anything, just that the check against
 * filename extension will be done for files of "unknown" type.
 * If the player does not even know (reports) that it supports
 * ogg even though it does, please use the stronger

 * the latter 6 bytes (representing "code" and "transaction ID")
 * contain junk. This is breaking the PTP/MTP spec but works
 * on Windows anyway, probably because the Windows implementation
