            <p id="whitespace">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
            idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
            give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
            teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
            human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
            itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
            how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
            extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who <b>loves or
                pursues or desires</b> to obtain pain of itself, because it is
            pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
            and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
            example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
            except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to
            find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
            annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
            indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
            the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
            they cannot foresee</p>
