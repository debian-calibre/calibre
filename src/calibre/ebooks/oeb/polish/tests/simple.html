<p>To pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
painful.</p>

<p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no <em>annoying</em> consequences, or one who
avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
consequences that are extremely painful.</p>
