/** \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * libmspack is a library which provides compressors and decompressors,
 * archivers and dearchivers for Microsoft compression formats.
 *
 * \section formats Formats supported
 *
 * The following file formats are supported:
 * - SZDD files, which use LZSS compression
 * - KWAJ files, which use LZSS, LZSS+Huffman or deflate compression
 * - .HLP (MS Help) files, which use LZSS compression
 * - .CAB (MS Cabinet) files, which use deflate, LZX or Quantum compression
 * - .CHM (HTML Help) files, which use LZX compression
 * - .LIT (MS EBook) files, which use LZX compression and DES encryption
 *
 * To determine the capabilities of the library, and the binary
 * compatibility version of any particular compressor or decompressor, use
 * the mspack_version() function. The UNIX library interface version is
 * defined as the highest-versioned library component.
 *
 * \section starting Getting started
 *
 * The macro MSPACK_SYS_SELFTEST() should be used to ensure the library can
 * be used. In particular, it checks if the caller is using 32-bit file I/O
 * when the library is compiled for 64-bit file I/O and vice versa.
 *
 * If compiled normally, the library includes basic file I/O and memory
 * management functionality using the standard C library. This can be
 * customised and replaced entirely by creating a mspack_system structure.
 *
 * A compressor or decompressor for the required format must be
 * instantiated before it can be used. Each construction function takes
 * one parameter, which is either a pointer to a custom mspack_system
 * structure, or NULL to use the default. The instantiation returned, if
 * not NULL, contains function pointers (methods) to work with the given
 * file format.
 * 
 * For compression:
 * - mspack_create_cab_compressor() creates a mscab_compressor
 * - mspack_create_chm_compressor() creates a mschm_compressor
 * - mspack_create_lit_compressor() creates a mslit_compressor
 * - mspack_create_hlp_compressor() creates a mshlp_compressor
 * - mspack_create_szdd_compressor() creates a msszdd_compressor
 * - mspack_create_kwaj_compressor() creates a mskwaj_compressor
 *
 * For decompression:
 * - mspack_create_cab_decompressor() creates a mscab_decompressor
 * - mspack_create_chm_decompressor() creates a mschm_decompressor
 * - mspack_create_lit_decompressor() creates a mslit_decompressor
 * - mspack_create_hlp_decompressor() creates a mshlp_decompressor
 * - mspack_create_szdd_decompressor() creates a msszdd_decompressor
 * - mspack_create_kwaj_decompressor() creates a mskwaj_decompressor
 *
 * Once finished working with a format, each kind of
 * compressor/decompressor has its own specific destructor:
 * - mspack_destroy_cab_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_cab_decompressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_chm_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_chm_decompressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_lit_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_lit_decompressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_hlp_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_hlp_decompressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_szdd_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_szdd_decompressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_kwaj_compressor()
 * - mspack_destroy_kwaj_decompressor()
 *
 * Destroying a compressor or decompressor does not destroy any objects,
 * structures or handles that have been created using that compressor or
 * decompressor. Ensure that everything created or opened is destroyed or
 * closed before compressor/decompressor is itself destroyed.
 *
 * \section errors Error codes
 *
 * All compressors and decompressors use the same set of error codes. Most
 * methods return an error code directly. For methods which do not
 * return error codes directly, the error code can be obtained with the
 * last_error() method.
 *
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_OK is used to indicate success. This error code is defined
 *   as zero, all other code are non-zero.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_ARGS indicates that a method was called with inappropriate
 *   arguments.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_OPEN indicates that mspack_system::open() failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_READ indicates that mspack_system::read() failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_WRITE indicates that mspack_system::write() failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_SEEK indicates that mspack_system::seek() failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_NOMEMORY indicates that mspack_system::alloc() failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_SIGNATURE indicates that the file being read does not
 *   have the correct "signature". It is probably not a valid file for
 *   whatever format is being read.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_DATAFORMAT indicates that the file being used or read
 *   is corrupt.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_CHECKSUM indicates that a data checksum has failed.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_CRUNCH indicates an error occured during compression.
 * - #MSPACK_ERR_DECRUNCH indicates an error occured during decompression.

/* --- file I/O abstraction ------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * A structure which abstracts file I/O and memory management.
 *
 * The library always uses the mspack_system structure for interaction
 * with the file system and to allocate, free and copy all memory. It also
 * uses it to send literal messages to the library user.
 *
 * When the library is compiled normally, passing NULL to a compressor or
 * decompressor constructor will result in a default mspack_system being
 * used, where all methods are implemented with the standard C library.
 * However, all constructors support being given a custom created
 * mspack_system structure, with the library user's own methods. This
 * allows for more abstract interaction, such as reading and writing files
 * directly to memory, or from a network socket or pipe.
 *
 * Implementors of an mspack_system structure should read all
 * documentation entries for every structure member, and write methods
 * which conform to those standards.

   * be filled out like so:
   * - section: the correct value for the found file
   * - offset: the correct value for the found file
   * - length: the correct value for the found file
   * - all other structure elements: NULL or 0
   *
   * If the file was not found, MSPACK_ERR_OK will still be returned as the
   * result, but the caller-provided structure will be filled out like so:
   * - section: NULL
   * - offset: 0
   * - length: 0
   * - all other structure elements: NULL or 0

   * using the regular open().
