Start the calibre Content server. The calibre Content server exposes your
calibre libraries over the internet. You can specify the path to the library
folders as arguments to \fBcalibre\-server\fP\&. If you do not specify any paths, all the
libraries that the main calibre program knows about will be used.
.sp
Whenever you pass arguments to \fBcalibre\-server\fP that have spaces in them, enclose the arguments in quotation marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"

.B \-\-auth\-mode
Choose the type of authentication used.     Set the HTTP authentication mode used by the server. Set to \fB"\fPbasic\fB"\fP if you are putting this server behind an SSL proxy. Otherwise, leave it as \fB"\fPauto\fB"\fP, which will use \fB"\fPbasic\fB"\fP if SSL is configured otherwise it will use \fB"\fPdigest\fB"\fP\&.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-auto\-reload
Automatically reload server when source code changes. Useful for development. You should also specify a small value for the shutdown timeout.

Number of login failures for ban.   The number of login failures after which an IP address is banned
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ban\-for
Ban IP addresses that have repeated login failures.         Temporarily bans access for IP addresses that have repeated login failures for the specified number of minutes. Useful to prevent attempts at guessing passwords. If set to zero, no banning is done.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-\-compress\-min\-size
Minimum size for which responses use data compression (in bytes).
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-displayed\-fields
Restrict displayed user\-defined fields.     Comma separated list of user\-defined metadata fields that will be displayed by the Content server in the /opds and /mobile views. If you specify this option, any fields not in this list will not be displayed. For example: my_rating,my_tags
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-enable\-allow\-socket\-preallocation, \-\-disable\-allow\-socket\-preallocation
Socket pre\-allocation, for example, with systemd socket activation. By default, this option is enabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-auth, \-\-disable\-auth
Password based authentication to access the server.         Normally, the server is unrestricted, allowing anyone to access it. You can restrict access to predefined users with this option. By default, this option is disabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-fallback\-to\-detected\-interface, \-\-disable\-fallback\-to\-detected\-interface
Fallback to auto\-detected interface.        If for some reason the server is unable to bind to the interface specified in the listen_on option, then it will try to detect an interface that connects to the outside world and bind to that. By default, this option is enabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-local\-write, \-\-disable\-local\-write
Allow un\-authenticated local connections to make changes.   Normally, if you do not turn on authentication, the server operates in read\-only mode, so as to not allow anonymous users to make changes to your calibre libraries. This option allows anybody connecting from the same computer as the server is running on to make changes. This is useful if you want to run the server without authentication but still use calibredb to make changes to your calibre libraries. Note that turning on this option means any program running on the computer can make changes to your calibre libraries. By default, this option is disabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-log\-not\-found, \-\-disable\-log\-not\-found
Log HTTP 404 (Not Found) requests.  Normally, the server logs all HTTP requests for resources that are not found. This can generate a lot of log spam, if your server is targeted by bots. Use this option to turn it off. By default, this option is enabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-use\-bonjour, \-\-disable\-use\-bonjour
Advertise OPDS feeds via BonJour.   Advertise the OPDS feeds via the BonJour service, so that OPDS based reading apps can detect and connect to the server automatically. By default, this option is enabled.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-use\-sendfile, \-\-disable\-use\-sendfile
Zero copy file transfers for increased performance.         This will use zero\-copy in\-kernel transfers when sending files over the network, increasing performance. However, it can cause corrupted file transfers on some broken filesystems. If you experience corrupted file transfers, turn it off. By default, this option is enabled.
