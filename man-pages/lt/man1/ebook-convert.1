.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Convert an e\-book from one format to another.
.sp
input_file is the input and output_file is the output. Both must be specified as the first two arguments to the command.
.sp
The output e\-book format is guessed from the file extension of output_file. output_file can also be of the special format .EXT where EXT is the output file extension. In this case, the name of the output file is derived from the name of the input file. Note that the filenames must not start with a hyphen. Finally, if output_file has no extension, then it is treated as a directory and an "open e\-book" (OEB) consisting of HTML files is written to that directory. These files are the files that would normally have been passed to the output plugin.
.sp
After specifying the input and output file you can customize the conversion by specifying various options. The available options depend on the input and output file types. To get help on them specify the input and output file and then use the \-h option.
.sp
For full documentation of the conversion system see
conversion
.sp
Whenever you pass arguments to \fBebook\-convert\fP that have spaces in them, enclose the arguments in quotation marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"
.sp
The options and default values for the options change depending on both the
input and output formats, so you should always check with:

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dont\-split\-on\-page\-breaks
Turn off splitting at page breaks. Normally, input files are automatically split at every page break into two files. This gives an output e\-book that can be parsed faster and with less resources. However, splitting is slow and if your source file contains a very large number of page breaks, you should turn off splitting on page breaks.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-epub\-flatten
This option is needed only if you intend to use the EPUB with FBReaderJ. It will flatten the file system inside the EPUB, putting all files into the top level.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-flow\-size
Split all HTML files larger than this size (in KB). This is necessary as most EPUB readers cannot handle large file sizes. The default of 260KB is the size required for Adobe Digital Editions. Set to 0 to disable size based splitting.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-default\-epub\-cover
Normally, if the input file has no cover and you don\fB\(aq\fPt specify one, a default cover is generated with the title, authors, etc. This option disables the generation of this cover.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-svg\-cover
Do not use SVG for the book cover. Use this option if your EPUB is going to be used on a device that does not support SVG, like the iPhone or the JetBook Lite. Without this option, such devices will display the cover as a blank page.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-preserve\-cover\-aspect\-ratio
When using an SVG cover, this option will cause the cover to scale to cover the available screen area, but still preserve its aspect ratio (ratio of width to height). That means there may be white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image, but the image will never be distorted. Without this option the image may be slightly distorted, but there will be no borders.

.B \-\-asciiize
Transliterate unicode characters to an ASCII representation. Use with care because this will replace unicode characters with ASCII. For instance it will replace \fB"\fPМихаил Горбачёв\fB"\fP with \fB"\fPMikhail Gorbachiov\fB"\fP\&. Also, note that in cases where there are multiple representations of a character (characters shared by Chinese and Japanese for instance) the representation based on the current calibre interface language will be used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-base\-font\-size
The base font size in pts. All font sizes in the produced book will be rescaled based on this size. By choosing a larger size you can make the fonts in the output bigger and vice versa. By default, the base font size is chosen based on the output profile you chose.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-change\-justification
Change text justification. A value of \fB"\fPleft\fB"\fP converts all justified text in the source to left aligned (i.e. unjustified) text. A value of \fB"\fPjustify\fB"\fP converts all unjustified text to justified. A value of \fB"\fPoriginal\fB"\fP (the default) does not change justification in the source file. Note that only some output formats support justification.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-disable\-font\-rescaling
Disable all rescaling of font sizes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-embed\-all\-fonts
Embed every font that is referenced in the input document but not already embedded. This will search your system for the fonts, and if found, they will be embedded. Embedding will only work if the format you are converting to supports embedded fonts, such as EPUB, AZW3, DOCX or PDF. Please ensure that you have the proper license for embedding the fonts used in this document.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-embed\-font\-family
Embed the specified font family into the book. This specifies the \fB"\fPbase\fB"\fP font used for the book. If the input document specifies its own fonts, they may override this base font. You can use the filter style information option to remove fonts from the input document. Note that font embedding only works with some output formats, principally EPUB, AZW3 and DOCX.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-expand\-css
By default, calibre will use the shorthand form for various CSS properties such as margin, padding, border, etc. This option will cause it to use the full expanded form instead. Note that CSS is always expanded when generating EPUB files with the output profile set to one of the Nook profiles as the Nook cannot handle shorthand CSS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-extra\-css
Either the path to a CSS stylesheet or raw CSS. This CSS will be appended to the style rules from the source file, so it can be used to override those rules.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-filter\-css
A comma separated list of CSS properties that will be removed from all CSS style rules. This is useful if the presence of some style information prevents it from being overridden on your device. For example: font\-family,color,margin\-left,margin\-right
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-font\-size\-mapping
Mapping from CSS font names to font sizes in pts. An example setting is 12,12,14,16,18,20,22,24. These are the mappings for the sizes xx\-small to xx\-large, with the final size being for huge fonts. The font rescaling algorithm uses these sizes to intelligently rescale fonts. The default is to use a mapping based on the output profile you chose.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-insert\-blank\-line
Insert a blank line between paragraphs. Will not work if the source file does not use paragraphs (<p> or <div> tags).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-insert\-blank\-line\-size
Set the height of the inserted blank lines (in em). The height of the lines between paragraphs will be twice the value set here.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-ligatures
Preserve ligatures present in the input document. A ligature is a special rendering of a pair of characters like ff, fi, fl et cetera. Most readers do not have support for ligatures in their default fonts, so they are unlikely to render correctly. By default, calibre will turn a ligature into the corresponding pair of normal characters. This option will preserve them instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-line\-height
The line height in pts. Controls spacing between consecutive lines of text. Only applies to elements that do not define their own line height. In most cases, the minimum line height option is more useful. By default no line height manipulation is performed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-linearize\-tables
Some badly designed documents use tables to control the layout of text on the page. When converted these documents often have text that runs off the page and other artifacts. This option will extract the content from the tables and present it in a linear fashion.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-margin\-bottom
Set the bottom margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to be set (the margin setting in the original document will be preserved). Note: Page oriented formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-margin\-left
Set the left margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to be set (the margin setting in the original document will be preserved). Note: Page oriented formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-margin\-right
Set the right margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to be set (the margin setting in the original document will be preserved). Note: Page oriented formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-margin\-top
Set the top margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to be set (the margin setting in the original document will be preserved). Note: Page oriented formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-minimum\-line\-height
The minimum line height, as a percentage of the element\fB\(aq\fPs calculated font size. calibre will ensure that every element has a line height of at least this setting, irrespective of what the input document specifies. Set to zero to disable. Default is 120%. Use this setting in preference to the direct line height specification, unless you know what you are doing. For example, you can achieve \fB"\fPdouble spaced\fB"\fP text by setting this to 240.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-paragraph\-spacing
Remove spacing between paragraphs. Also sets an indent on paragraphs of 1.5em. Spacing removal will not work if the source file does not use paragraphs (<p> or <div> tags).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-paragraph\-spacing\-indent\-size
When calibre removes blank lines between paragraphs, it automatically sets a paragraph indent, to ensure that paragraphs can be easily distinguished. This option controls the width of that indent (in em). If you set this value negative, then the indent specified in the input document is used, that is, calibre does not change the indentation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-subset\-embedded\-fonts
Subset all embedded fonts. Every embedded font is reduced to contain only the glyphs used in this document. This decreases the size of the font files. Useful if you are embedding a particularly large font with lots of unused glyphs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-transform\-css\-rules
Path to a file containing rules to transform the CSS styles in this book. The easiest way to create such a file is to use the wizard for creating rules in the calibre GUI. Access it in the \fB"\fPLook & feel\->Transform styles\fB"\fP section of the conversion dialog. Once you create the rules, you can use the \fB"\fPExport\fB"\fP button to save them to a file.
