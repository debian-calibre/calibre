Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection onto
your carefully crafted e\-books.
.sp
Polishing tries to minimize the changes to the internal code of your e\-book.
Unlike conversion, it does not flatten CSS, rename files, change font
sizes, adjust margins, etc. Every action performs only the minimum set of
changes needed for the desired effect.
.sp
You should use this tool as the last step in your e\-book creation process.
.sp
Note that polishing only works on files in the AZW3 or EPUB formats.
.sp
Whenever you pass arguments to \fBebook\-polish\fP that have spaces in them, enclose the arguments in quotation marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"

.B \-\-remove\-unused\-css, \-u
Remove all unused CSS rules from stylesheets and <style> tags. Some books created from production templates can have a large number of extra CSS rules that dont match any actual content. These extra rules can slow down readers that need to parse them all.

.B \-\-smarten\-punctuation, \-p
Convert plain text dashes, ellipsis, quotes, multiple hyphens, etc. into their typographically correct equivalents. Note that the algorithm can sometimes generate incorrect results, especially when single quotes at the start of contractions are involved.

.B \-\-subset\-fonts, \-f
Subsetting fonts means reducing an embedded font to contain only the characters used from that font in the book. This greatly reduces the size of the font files (halving the font file sizes is common). For example, if the book uses a specific font for headers, then subsetting will reduce that font to contain only the characters present in the actual headers in the book. Or if the book embeds the bold and italic versions of a font, but bold and italic text is relatively rare, or absent altogether, then the bold and italic fonts can either be reduced to only a few characters or completely removed. The only downside to subsetting fonts is that if, at a later date you decide to add more text to your books, the newly added text might not be covered by the subset font.
