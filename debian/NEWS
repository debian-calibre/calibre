calibre (4.99.3+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This is the first version of Calibre using Python3 uploaded to sid.
    It is a pre-release based on calibre 4.8 with additional fixes
    for Python3. We expect upstream to switch completely to Python3
    with the release of calibre 5.0 around mid 2020.

    WARNING: External plugins are still mostly not ready for Python3, that
    means that many of them will not work with this version. If you need
    these plugins to work, do **NOT** update to this version, or install
    the Linux version as distributed by upstream.

calibre (4.3.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Conversion to PDF is currently (since version 4) broken due to Qt
    libraries being too old. The moment Qt 5.13 will be included in
    Debian, conversion will start again.
