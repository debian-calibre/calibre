calibre (4.0.0+really3.48.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Due to the removal of Python 2 from Debian, support for necessary modules
  to run Calibre >= 4.0.0 are not available.

  We recommend users to use upstream Calibre packages to obtain new
  features and security fixes, until upstream together with plugin
  authors switch to Python3. Until that point Calibre in Debian will be
  frozen at the last 3.NN version (3.48) and no further features or security
  fixes can be applied.
