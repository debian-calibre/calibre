Customizing calibre
==================================

calibre has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized.  Here, you will learn:

    * how to use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize calibre's behavior,
    * how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to override the defaults
    * how to use *plugins* to add functionality to calibre.
    * how to share icon themes and plugins with other calibre users.
    * to see how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content to calibre visit the Section :ref:`news`.

.. note::
    Note that although icon themes and plugins are indexed and downloadable
    via calibre's builtin updater, they are not part of calibre, and their
    canonical locations for support and source code are on the `Mobileread forums
    <https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=166>`__ in their support
    threads.

Environment variables
-----------------------

    * ``CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`` - sets the folder where configuration files are stored/read.
    * ``CALIBRE_TEMP_DIR`` - sets the temporary folder used by calibre
    * ``CALIBRE_CACHE_DIRECTORY`` - sets the folder calibre uses to cache persistent data between sessions
    * ``CALIBRE_OVERRIDE_DATABASE_PATH`` - allows you to specify the full path to metadata.db. Using this variable you can have metadata.db be in a location other than the library folder. Useful if your library folder is on a networked drive that does not support file locking.
    * ``CALIBRE_DEVELOP_FROM`` - used to run from a calibre development environment. See :ref:`develop`.
    * ``CALIBRE_OVERRIDE_LANG`` - used to force the language used by the interface (ISO 639 language code)
    * ``CALIBRE_TEST_TRANSLATION`` - used to test a translation .po file (should be the path to the .po file)
    * ``CALIBRE_NO_NATIVE_FILEDIALOGS`` - causes calibre to not use native file dialogs for selecting files/folders.
    * ``CALIBRE_NO_NATIVE_MENUBAR`` - causes calibre to not create a native (global) menu on Ubuntu Unity and similar Linux desktop environments. The menu is instead placed inside the window, as is traditional.
    * ``CALIBRE_USE_SYSTEM_THEME`` - by default, on Linux, calibre uses its own
      builtin Qt style. This is to avoid crashes and hangs caused by incompatibilities
      between the version of Qt calibre is built against and the system Qt. The
      downside is that calibre may not follow the system look and feel. If
      you set this environment variable on Linux, it will cause calibre to use
      the system theme -- beware of crashes and hangs.
    * ``CALIBRE_SHOW_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`` - causes calibre to print deprecation warnings to stdout. Useful for calibre developers.
    * ``CALIBRE_NO_DEFAULT_PROGRAMS`` - prevent calibre from automatically registering the filetypes it is capable of handling with Windows.
    * ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM`` - On Linux set this to ``wayland`` to force calibre to use Wayland and ``xcb`` to force use of X11.
    * ``SYSFS_PATH`` - Use if sysfs is mounted somewhere other than /sys
    * ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy`` - used on Linux to specify an HTTP(S) proxy

See `How to set environment variables in Windows <https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm>`_. If you are on macOS
you can set environment variables by creating the :file:`~/Library/Preferences/calibre/macos-env.txt` and putting
the environment variables one per line in it, for example::

    CALIBRE_DEVELOP_FROM=$HOME/calibre-src/src
    CALIBRE_NO_NATIVE_FILEDIALOGS=1
    CALIBRE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY=~/.config/calibre


Tweaks
------------

Tweaks are small changes that you can specify to control various aspects of calibre's behavior. You can change them by going to Preferences->Advanced->Tweaks.
The default values for the tweaks are reproduced below

.. literalinclude:: ../resources/default_tweaks.py


Overriding icons, templates, et cetera
----------------------------------------

.. note::
   calibre has direct support for icon themes, there are several icon themes
   available for calibre, that you can use by going to :guilabel:`Preferences->Interface->Look & Feel->Change icon theme`.
   It is preferable to use icon themes over overriding individual icons.


calibre allows you to override the static resources, like icons, JavaScript and
templates for the metadata jacket, catalogs, etc. with customized versions that
you like.  All static resources are stored in the resources sub-folder of the
calibre install location. On Windows, this is usually :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Calibre2\\app\\resources`.
On macOS, :file:`/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/Resources/resources/`. On Linux, if
you are using the binary installer from the calibre website it will be
:file:`/opt/calibre/resources`. These paths can change depending on where you
choose to install calibre.

You should not change the files in this resources folder, as your changes will
get overwritten the next time you update calibre. Instead, go to
:guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Miscellaneous` and click
:guilabel:`Open calibre configuration folder`. In this configuration folder, create a
sub-folder called resources and place the files you want to override in it.
Place the files in the appropriate sub folders, for example place images in
:file:`resources/images`, etc. calibre will automatically use your custom file
in preference to the built-in one the next time it is started.

For example, if you wanted to change the icon for the :guilabel:`Remove books`
action, you would first look in the built-in resources folder and see that the
relevant file is :file:`resources/images/remove_books.png`. Assuming you have an
alternate icon in PNG format called :file:`my_remove_books.png` you would save it in
the configuration folder as :file:`resources/images/remove_books.png`. All the
icons used by the calibre user interface are in :file:`resources/images` and
its sub-folders. Placing an override file here will have even higher priority
than a custom icon theme.

Creating your own icon theme for calibre
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you have created a beautiful set of icons and wish to share them with other
calibre users via calibre's builtin icon theme support, you can easily package
up your icons into a theme. To do so, go to
:guilabel:`Preferences->Miscellaneous->Create icon theme`, select the folder
where you have put your icons. Then fill up the theme
metadata and click OK. This will result in a ZIP file containing the theme
icons. You can upload that to the calibre forum at `Mobileread
<https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=166>`__ and then I will
make your theme available via calibre's builtin icon theme system.
By default, the icon theme you just created will also be installed as the
current theme in calibre. If you are testing your theme, remember to remove
the images from the :file:`resources/images` folder so that the icons from the
theme are used.

As of calibre 6, you can have custom icons for light and dark mode. Simply
create two versions of the icon and name the files with the suffix
``-for-dark-theme`` and ``-for-light-theme``. For example,
``modified-for-dark-theme.png`` and ``modified-for-light-theme.png``. Then
calibre will automatically use the appropriate icon based on the current theme.

Customizing calibre with plugins
--------------------------------

calibre has a very modular design. Almost all functionality in calibre comes in
the form of plugins. Plugins are used for conversion, for downloading news
(though these are called recipes), for various components of the user
interface, to connect to different devices, to process files when adding them
to calibre and so on. You can get a complete list of all the built-in plugins
in calibre by going to :guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Plugins`.

You can write your own plugins to customize and extend the behavior of calibre.
The plugin architecture in calibre is very simple, see the tutorial
:ref:`pluginstutorial`.

Once you have written a plugin, you can upload that to the calibre plugins
forum at `Mobileread
<https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=237>`__ and it will be
made available via calibre's builtin plugin updater.
