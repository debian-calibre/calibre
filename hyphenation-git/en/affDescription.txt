This file is a summary of the switches used in the en_GB affix file.
A description of the affix file format is appended to the end of this

In addition to the new suffix and prefix rules a modified TRY list is
used in order to properly find spelling errors in words having . (period)
' (apostrophe) and - (hyphen) within them. A replacement list for common
mis-spellings has also been incorporated.

The en_GB.aff affix file was created from scratch by David Bartlett and 
Andrew Brown.

What follows is cut and pasted from the instructions at
http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/affix.readme

The first line has 4 fields:

Field
-----
1     SFX - indicates this is a suffix
2     D   - is the name of the character which represents this suffix
3     Y   - indicates it can be combined with prefixes (cross product)
4     4   - indicates that sequence of 4 affix entries are needed to
               properly store the affix information

The remaining lines describe the unique information for the 4 affix
entries that make up this affix.  Each line can be interpreted
as follows: (note fields 1 and 2 are used as a check against line 1 info)

Field
-----
1     SFX         - indicates this is a suffix
2     D           - is the name of the character which represents this affix
3     y           - the string of chars to strip off before adding affix
                         (a 0 here indicates the NULL string)
4     ied         - the string of affix characters to add
                         (a 0 here indicates the NULL string)
5     [^aeiou]y   - the conditions which must be met before the affix
                    can be applied

Field 5 is interesting.  Since this is a suffix, field 5 tells us that
there are 2 conditions that must be met.  The first condition is that
the next to the last character in the word must *NOT* be any of the
following "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u".  The second condition is that
the last character of the word must end in "y".
