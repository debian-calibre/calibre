The working-out of the Italian Dictionary of Synonyms has been started in the year 2003/2004 by the class III H of the Liceo Scientifico, one of the High Schools belonging to the Institute Keynes in Castel Maggiore (Bologna) in the field of a school project of introduction to the computer technologies. Different linguistic and lexical competences, developed with Mrs Maria Angela Mazzini, the teacher of Italian language and literature, have come into play. These abilities have allowed to draw up a list of synonyms for the words beginning with the letters A and B.
The activity has been carried out in cooperation with the Computer Community with the help of voluntary workers not belonging to the school environment. Furthermore the class III A of the Institute Leonida Rapaci in Vibo Valentia. The link between all the people who have worked on the project has been possible thanks to the e-mail and to the space placed at the Institute Keynes disposal and has been coordinated by Mrs Daniela Volta, the teacher responsible for the Computer technologies of the Institute Keynes. This experience shows that in the school it is possible to achieve an active and experimental approach to the computer technologies, with the aid of competences concerning different subjects, in this specific case the Italian language.
