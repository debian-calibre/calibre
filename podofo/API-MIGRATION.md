# 1.0.* -> 1.1

- `PdfFontFactory`: Removed, this was a leftover of a removed class,
  as a friendship declaration
- `PdfFontMetricsFreetype`: The `GetFaceHandle` can now be accessed only by
setting `PODOFO_3RDPARTY_INTEROP_ENABLED`. This was forgotten in 1.0 release
- `PdfCharCodeList`: Removed. This was used only privately and had a big
CHECK-ME/TODO asking for optimization. This was probably forgotten
and not migrated to private code

# 1.0.2 -> 1.0.1
- `PdfSignerCmsParams`: Deprecated `Encryption` field. The encryption is determined
  from the public key in the X.509 certificate

## 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
- `PdfXMPPacket`: make reserved 3rd party interop `GetDescription` non const, as we
  generally ensure const correctness in all the API (with limited exceptions)

## 0.10.1 -> 1.0.0
- `PdfFontConfigWrapper`: Put `GetFcConfig()` and the constructor with `FcConfig*`
  argument under guard by the `PODOFO_3RDPARTY_INTEROP_ENABLED` macro
- `PdfXMPPacket`: `GetDoc()`, `GetOrCreateDescription()`, `GetDescription()`
  are now guarded by `PODOFO_3RDPARTY_INTEROP_ENABLED` macro
- `PdfContent`: the class is now generally not internally accessible as it was before.
  You can now get content fields with safe getters, or you can directly access them
  with `operator*` and `operator->` overloads, possibly after checking the type,
  errors and warnings with `GetType()`, `GetErrors()` and `GetWarnings()`
- `PdfEncodingMapFactory`:
  * `WinAnsiEncodingInstance()` renamed to `GetWinAnsiEncodingInstancePt()`
  * `MacRomanEncodingInstance()` renamed to `GetPtrMacRomanEncodingInstancePtr()`
  * `MacExpertEncodingInstance()` renamed to `GetMacExpertEncodingInstancePtr()`
  * `TwoBytesHorizontalIdentityEncodingInstance()` renamed to `GetHorizontalIdentityEncodingInstancePtr()`
  * `TwoBytesVerticalIdentityEncodingInstance()` renamed to `GetVerticalIdentityEncodingInstancePtr()`
  * `GetStandard14FontEncodingMap()` renamed to `GetStandard14FontEncodingInstancePtr()`
- `PdfDifferenceEncoding`:
  * Inverted parameters in constructor
  * `NameToCodePoint()`: Renamed to `TryGetCodePointsFromCharName()`, changed the semantics and now it returns a `CodePointSpan` instead of `char32_t`
  * `CodePointToName()`: Removed. It's not so simple to have an inverse map from code points to AGL name: there are multiple AGL lists and in the same AGL list there are ambiguous mappings. You can find a safest alternative in `PdfPredefinedEncodingType::TryGetCharNameFromCodePoint()` but it supports a smaller character set
- `PdfDifferenceList`:
  * Renamed to `PdfDifferenceMap`
  * `TryGetMappedName` now returns a `CodePointSpan` instead of `char32_t` in the overload
  * `AddDifference`: Removed overload with name. Use `PdfDifferenceEncoding::TryGetCodePointsFromCharName()` first if you need a replacement
- `Object<T>`: Renamed to `ObjectAdapter<T>`
- `PdfArray`: `FindAtAs` doesn't take a default value anymore and throws on failed lookup . Use `FindAtAsSafe` instead
- `PdfDictionary`: `GetKeyAs`, `FindKeyAs`, `FindKeyAsParent`. doesn't take a default value anymore and throws on failed lookup . Use safe method versions instead
- `PdfXObjectForm`: Removed `HasRotation()`. Rotation is zero for xobject forms and it still implements privately `TryGetRotationRadians()`
- `PoDofo::TransformRectPage`: Removed `inputIsTransformed` parameter. Now the function accepts only rect in the canonical PDF coordinate system
- `PdfExtension`: Reworked constructor parameters
- `PdfTokenizer`:
  * Moved `IsWhitespace`, `IsDelimiter`, `IsTokenDelimiter`, `IsRegular`, `IsPrintable`  to `<podofo/optional/PdfUtils.h>`.
  It doesn't seems justified to have them as part of the regular public API in PdfTokenizer.
  Also renamed them with `IsChar` suffix.
  * `IsPrintable`: Renamed to `IsCharASCIIPrintable`. That should be the correct semantic of the method
- `PoDoFo::GetPdfOperator()`, `PoDoFo::TryGetPdfOperator()`, `PoDoFo::GetPdfOperatorName()`, `PoDoFo::TryGetPdfOperatorName()`: Make them private, include `<podofo/optional/PdfConvert.h>` for substitutes

- `PdfPageMode`:
  * Removed `DontCare` (which was something like a pointless "ignore")
  * Renamed `UseBookmarks` -> `UseOutlines`: "bookmark" is not really part of PDF terminology
- `PdfPageLayout`:
  * Removed `Ignore` (pointless)
  * Removed `Default`: just use nullptr in `PdfCatalog::SetPageLayout()`
- `GIDMap`: Removed, it was just a infrastructural typedef
- `PdfCIDToGIDMap`: Removed `HasGlyphAccess`, this map is always for accessing font program GIDs
- `PdfGlyphAccess`: `Width` renamed to `ReadMetrics`

  `PdfShadingPatternDefinition`
- `PdfPainter`:
  * `SetTilingPattern`, `SetShadingPattern`, `SetStrokingShadingPattern`, `SetStrokingTilingPattern`:
    Removed, use the `SetStrokingPattern`,`SetShadingPattern`, `SetStrokingUncolouredTilingPattern`,
    `SetNonStrokingUncolouredTilingPattern`
  * Removed setting `PdfPainterFlags` in the constructor and moved to the `SetCanvas(canvas, flags)` method instead
- `PdfFontMetrics`:
  * `GetFontNameSafe()` removed: Just use `GetFontName` instead
  * `GetBaseFontName()`: make it protected, `GeFamilyFontNameSafe()` it's the closest substitute
  * `GetBaseFontNameSafe()`: removed, `GeFamilyFontNameSafe()` it's the closest substitute 
  * `GetBoundingBox()` now returns `Corners`
  * `TryGetImplicitEncoding()`: removed, no substitute supplied. Retrieving a implicit encoding it's more involuted
  * `GetCIDToGIDMap()`: removed, no substitute supplied. CID to GID mappings can be retrieved only from the font
- `PdfFontMatchBehaviorFlags`: `MatchPostScriptName` inverted logic and renamed to `SkipMatchPostScriptName`
- `PdfFontConfigSearchFlags`: `MatchPostScriptName` inverted logic and renamed to `SkipMatchPostScriptName`
- `PdfContentType`:

- `PdfContentReaderFlags`: Renamed `DontFollowXObjectForms` -> `SkipFollowFormXObjects`
- `PdfFont`:
  * Renamed `IsCIDKeyed()` -> `IsCIDFont()`, which is less confusing
  * Renamed `AddSubsetGIDs` -> `AddSubsetCIDs`
  * Renamed `TryGetSubstituteFont` -> `TryCreateProxyFont`
  * Removed `GetUsedGIDs`: it was more implementation detail for various embedding operations

    `OutlineItemAlreadyPresent`, `NotLoadedForUpdate`, `CannotEncryptedForUpdate`,
    `InvalidHexString`, `InvalidStreamLength`, `InvalidXRefType`
- `PdfDocument`:
  * Removed `AttachFile()`, `GetAttachment()`: Use `GetNames().GetNameTree<PdfEmbeddedFiles>()` or similar methods and use that instance
  * Removed `AddNamedDestination()`: Use `GetNames().GetTree<PdfDestinations>()` or similar methods and use that instance
- `PdfName`: Removed `operator<`, `std::hash` overload. Just use new `PdfNameMap`, `PdfNameHashMap`,
  or use `PdfNameInequality`, `PdfNameEquality` and `PdfNameHashing` to create your new data structure
- `PdfNameComparator`: Renamed to `PdfNameInequality`
- `PdfDictionaryMap`: Renamed to `PdfNameMap`
- `PdfResources`: Moved all string resource type functions to the `PdfResourceOperations` interface and
  make all the implementations private. Cast `PdfResources` instances to this `PdfResourceOperations`
  interface if you want to use the now reserved generic functions
- `PdfXObject`, `PdfFont`: Removed `GetIdentifier()`, the identifiers are now generated when inserted to `PdfResources`
- `PdfXObjet:SetMatrix()`: Removed and moved it to `PdfXObjectForm` (specification tells it doesn't belong to other XObject)

  * Renamed `MoveAt()` -> `MoveTo()`
  * Removed `SetPageWidth()`, `SetPageHeight()`. Use `SetRect()`, `SetMediaBox()`, `SetCropBox()`, etc. instead
  * Removed `SetICCProfile()`, `SetICCProfile()`: create a
  `PdfColorSpaceFilterICCBased` and set it through `PdfGraphicsStateWrapper::SetNonStrokingColorSpace`
  * `GetResources()`: Now it returns a reference instead (reflecting in the specification resources is required for pages)
  * `MustGetResources()`: Removed, use the reference returning `GetResources()` instead
  * Renamed `HasRotation()` -> `TryGetRotationRadians()`
  * Removed `GetRotationRaw()` and introduced `TryGetRotationRaw()`

- `PdfEncrypt`:
  * `GenerateEncryptionKey` renamed to `EnsureEncryptionInitialized` and takes `PdfEncryptContxt` as an argument
  * `Authenticate`, `EncryptTo`, `DecryptTo`, `CreateEncryptionInputStream`, `CreateEncryptionOutputStream` now take `PdfEncryptContxt` as an argument
- `PdfIndirectObjectList`:
  * `SetStreamFactory` is now private, it's supposed to be used only by private PdfImmediateWriter
  * `ReplaceObject`: Removed, it was added during pdfmm times when there was no better way to rewrite object streams without temporary objects
  * `SetCanReuseObjectNumbers`, `GetCanReuseObjectNumbers`: Removed, the default is true ans it's untested with false. Reusing object numbers
    is a standard PDF feature and it's better to fix bugs in that part (if any) than allowing to mess with internal indirect object numbering
    in the public API
  * `RemoveObject()`, `CreateStream()`, `Attach()` `Detach`, `Clear()`,`BeginAppendStream()`,`EndAppendStream()`, `TryIncrementObjectCount()`:
    Removed from the public API: They have always been for inner use and dangerous to call for the user. For object removal we now rely on garbage collection

- Moved `PdfCMapEncoding::CreateFromObject` to `PdfEncodingMapFactory::ParseCMapEncoding`
- `PdfNameTree`:
  * Renamed -> `PdfNameTrees`

  * `ToDictionary` now takes `std::map<PdfString, PdfObject>` as input
  * `HasValue` -> renamed to `HasKey`
- Renamed enum `PdfColorSpace` -> `PdfColorSpaceType`, `PdfColorSpace` is now a doc element.

- `PdfCanvas`:
  * `GetRectRaw()` now returns `Corners` instead of `Rect`
  * Rename `GetStreamForAppending()` -> `GetOrCreateContentsStream()`
  * Removed `GetFromResources`: just use `GetResources`
