"In calibre, a virtual library is a way to tell calibre to open only a subset"
" of a normal library. For example, you might want to only work with books by"
" a certain author, or books having only a certain tag. Using virtual "
"libraries is the preferred way of partitioning your large book collection "
"into smaller sub collections. It is superior to splitting up your library "
"into multiple smaller libraries as, when you want to search through your "
"entire collection, you can simply go back to the full library. There is no "
"way to search through multiple separate libraries simultaneously in calibre."

"A virtual library is different from a simple search. A search will only "
"restrict the list of books shown in the book list. A virtual library does "
"that, and in addition it also restricts the entries shown in the "
":guilabel:`Tag Browser` to the left. The Tag Browser will only show tags, "
"authors, series, publishers, etc. that come from the books in the virtual "
"library. A virtual library thus behaves as though the actual library "
"contains only the restricted set of books."

"Virtual Libraries are based on *searches*. You can use any search as the "
"basis of a virtual library. The virtual library will contain only the books "
"matched by that search. First, type in the search you want to use in the "
