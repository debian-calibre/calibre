"calibre includes an integrated e-book comparison tool that can be used to "
"see what has changed inside an e-book after editing or converting it. It can"
" compare books in the EPUB and AZW3 formats."

msgid ""
"To use it, either open the e-book in the tool for :ref:`edit` and then click"
" :guilabel:`File->Compare to other book` or use the :ref:`book_details` "
"panel. If you do a conversion from EPUB to EPUB, the original EPUB file will"
" be saved as ORIGINAL_EPUB. Simply right click on the ORIGINAL_EPUB entry in"
" the Book details panel and choose :guilabel:`Compare to EPUB format`."

"As can be seen in the screenshot above, the comparison view shows the "
"differences between the two books side by side. Only the differences, with a"
" few lines of context around them are shown. This makes it easy to see at a "
"glance only what was changed inside a large document like a book."

"The line numbers of all changed text are show at the sides, making it easy "

"One useful technique when comparing books is to tell the comparison tool to "
"beautify the text and style files before calculating differences. This can "
"often result in cleaner and easier to follow differences. To do this, click "
"the :guilabel:`Options` button in the bottom right and choose "
":guilabel:`Beautify files before comparing`. Note that beautifying can "
"sometimes have undesired effects, as it can cause invalid markup to be "
"altered to make it valid. You can also change the number of lines of context"
" shown around differences via the :guilabel:`Options` button."

"The :ref:`edit` tool has a very useful feature, called :ref:`checkpoints`. "
"This allows you to save the current state of the book as a named "
"*checkpoint*, to which you can revert if you do not like the changes you "
"have made since creating the checkpoint. Checkpoints are also created "
"automatically when you perform various automated actions in the editor. You "
"can see the list of checkpoints by going to :guilabel:`View->Checkpoints` "
"and then use the :guilabel:`Compare` button to compare the book at the "
"selected checkpoint with the current state. The comparison tool will show "
"the checkpoint on the left and the current state on the right."
