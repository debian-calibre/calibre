"You can view any of the books in your calibre library by selecting the book "
"and pressing the :guilabel:`View` button. This will open up the book in the "
"E-book viewer. You can also launch the E-book viewer by itself from the "
"Start menu in Windows or using the command :command:`ebook-viewer` in Linux "
"and macOS (you have to install the command line tools on macOS first by "
"going to :guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Miscellaneous`)."

"You can \"turn pages\" in a book by using the :guilabel:`Page previous` "
"|prev| and :guilabel:`Page next` |next| buttons, or by pressing the "
":guilabel:`Page down`/:guilabel:`Page up` keys. Unlike most e-book viewers, "
"calibre does not force you to view books in paged mode. You can switch to "
"flow mode by clicking on the scroll mode button |scroll| at the top right. "
"You can then scroll by amounts less than a page by using the scroll bar or "
"various customizable keyboard shortcuts."

"actually saved in the EPUB file itself. You can add bookmarks, then send the"

"both your current position and the total length of the book. These numbers "
"are independent of the screen size and font size you are viewing the book "
"at, and they play a similar role to page numbers in paper books. You can "
"enter any number you like to go to the corresponding location in the book."
