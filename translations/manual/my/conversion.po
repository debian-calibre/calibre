"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try"
" hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However,"
" calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are "
"as suitable as others for conversion to e-books. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note "
"however that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full "
"blown e-book editor. To edit e-books, I recommend first converting them to "
"EPUB or AZW3 using calibre and then using the :guilabel:`Edit book` feature "
"to get them into perfect shape. You can then use the edited e-book as input "
"for conversion into other formats in calibre."

"The input format is first converted to XHTML by the appropriate *Input "

"The transforms that act on the XHTML output are where all the work happens. "
"There are various transforms, for example, to insert book metadata as a page"

"It is important to remeber that all the transforms act on the XHTML output "
"by the *Input Plugin*, not on the input file itself. So, for example, if you"
" ask calibre to convert an RTF file to EPUB, it will first be converted to "
"XHTML internally, the various transforms will be applied to the XHTML and "

"The base font size of a document is the most common font size in that "
"document, i.e., the size of the bulk of text in that document. When you "
"specify a :guilabel:`Base font size`, calibre automatically rescales all "
"font sizes in the document proportionately, so that the most common font "
"size becomes the specified base font size and other font sizes are rescaled "
"appropriately. By choosing a larger base font size, you can make the fonts "
"in the document larger and vice versa. When you set the base font size, for "
"best results, you should also set the font size key."

"The :guilabel:`Font size key` option lets you control how non-base font "
"sizes are rescaled. The font rescaling algorithm works using a font size "
"key, which is simply a comma-separated list of font sizes. The font size key"
" tells calibre how many \"steps\" bigger or smaller a given font size should"
" be compared to the base font size. The idea is that there should be a "
"limited number of font sizes in a document. For example, one size for the "
"body text, a couple of sizes for different levels of headings and a couple "
"of sizes for super/sub scripts and footnotes. The font size key allows "
"calibre to compartmentalize the font sizes in the input documents into "
"separate \"bins\" corresponding to the different logical font sizes."

"Let's illustrate with an example. Suppose the source document we are "

"Normally, paragraphs in XHTML are rendered with a blank line between them "

" :guilabel:`Remove spacing between paragraphs` forcefully ensure that all "

"1.5em (can be changed) to mark the start of every paragraph. "
":guilabel:`Insert blank line` does the opposite, guaranteeing that there is "
"exactly one blank line between each pair of paragraphs. Both these options "
"are very comprehensive, removing spacing, or inserting it for *all* "
"paragraphs (technically <p> and <div> tags). This is so that you can just "
