"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try"
" hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However,"
" calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are "
"as suitable as others for conversion to ebooks. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note "
"however that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full "
"blown ebook editor. To edit ebooks, I recommend first converting them to "
"EPUB or AZW3 using calibre and then using the Edit Book feature to get them "
"into perfect shape. You can then use the edited ebook as input for "
"conversion into other formats in calibre."

"The transforms that act on the XHTML output are where all the work happens. "
"There are various transforms, for example, to insert book metadata as a page"

"It is important to remeber that all the transforms act on the XHTML output "

" ask calibre to convert an RTF file to EPUB, it will first be converted to "
"XHTML internally, the various transforms will be applied to the XHTML and "
"then the *Output Plugin* will create the EPUB file, automatically generating"

"The :guilabel:`Font size key` option lets you control how non-base font "

" tells calibre how many \"steps\" bigger or smaller a given font size should"

"limited number of font sizes in a document. For example, one size for the "
"body text, a couple of sizes for different levels of headings and a couple "
"of sizes for super/sub scripts and footnotes. The font size key allows "
"calibre to compartmentalize the font sizes in the input documents into "
