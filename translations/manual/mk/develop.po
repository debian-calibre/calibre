"calibre has its roots in the Unix world, which means that its design is "
"highly modular. The modules interact with each other via well defined "
"interfaces. This makes adding new features and fixing bugs in calibre very "
"easy, resulting in a frenetic pace of development. Because of its roots, "
"calibre has a comprehensive command line interface for all its functions, "
"documented in :doc:`generated/en/cli-index`."

"The modular design of calibre is expressed via ``Plugins``. There is a "
":ref:`tutorial <customize>` on writing calibre plugins. For example, adding "
"support for a new device to calibre typically involves writing less than a "
"100 lines of code in the form of a device driver plugin. You can browse the "
"`built-in drivers "
"<https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/tree/master/src/calibre/devices>`_. "
"Similarly, adding support for new conversion formats involves writing "
"input/output format plugins. Another example of the modular design is the "
":ref:`recipe system <news>` for fetching news. For more examples of plugins "
"designed to add features to calibre, see the `Index of plugins "
"<https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1362767#post1362767>`_."
