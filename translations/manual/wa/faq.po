msgid ""
"Knowing the encoding of the source file: calibre tries to guess what "
"character encoding your source files use, but often, this is impossible, so "
"you need to tell it what encoding to use. This can be done in the GUI via "
"the :guilabel:`Input character encoding` field in the :guilabel:`Look & "
"feel->Text` section of the conversion dialog. The command-line tools have an"
" :option:`ebook-convert-txt-input --input-encoding` option."

"When adding HTML files to calibre, you may need to tell calibre what "
"encoding the files are in. To do this go to "
":guilabel:`Preferences->Advanced->Plugins->File Type plugins` and customize "
"the HTML2Zip plugin, telling it what encoding your HTML files are in. Now "
"when you add HTML files to calibre they will be correctly processed. HTML "
"files from different sources often have different encodings, so you may have"
" to change this setting repeatedly. A common encoding for many files from "
"the web is ``cp1252`` and I would suggest you try that first. Note that when"
" converting HTML files, leave the input encoding setting mentioned above "
"blank. This is because the HTML2ZIP plugin automatically converts the HTML "
"files to a standard encoding (utf-8)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:56
msgid ""
"The first thing to realize is that most e-books have two tables of contents."
" One is the traditional Table of Contents, like the ToC you find in paper "
"books. This Table of Contents is part of the main document flow and can be "
"styled however you like. This ToC is called the *content ToC*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:58
msgid ""
"Then there is the *metadata ToC*. A metadata ToC is a ToC that is not part "
"of the book text and is typically accessed by some special button on a "
"reader. For example, in the calibre E-book viewer, you use the Show Table of"
" Contents button to see this ToC. This ToC cannot be styled by the book "
"creator. How it is represented is up to the viewer program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:60
msgid ""
"In the MOBI format, the situation is a little confused. This is because the "
"MOBI format, alone amongst mainstream e-book formats, *does not* have decent"
" support for a metadata ToC. A MOBI book simulates the presence of a "
"metadata ToC by putting an *extra* content ToC at the end of the book. When "
"you click Goto Table of Contents on your Kindle, it is to this extra content"
" ToC that the Kindle takes you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:62
msgid ""
"Now it might well seem to you that the MOBI book has two identical ToCs. "
"Remember that one is semantically a content ToC and the other is a metadata "
"ToC, even though both might have exactly the same entries and look the same."
" One can be accessed directly from the Kindle's menus, the other cannot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:64
msgid ""
"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "
"document and generates an end-of-file ToC in the output MOBI file. You can "
"turn this off by an option in the MOBI Output settings. You can also tell "
"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"
" in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "
"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
"the default as it is, i.e. with the metadata ToC at the end of the book. "
"Also note that if you disable the generation of the end-of-file ToC the "
"resulting MOBI file may not function correctly on a Kindle, since the "
"Kindle's use the metadata ToC for many things, including the Page Flip "
"feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:66
msgid ""
"If you have a hand edited ToC in the input document, you can use the ToC "
"detection options in calibre to automatically generate the metadata ToC from"
" it. See the conversion section of the User Manual for more details on how "
"to use these options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:68
msgid ""
"Finally, I encourage you to ditch the content ToC and only have a metadata "
"ToC in your e-books. Metadata ToCs will give the people reading your e-books"
" a much superior navigation experience (except on the Kindle, where they are"
" essentially the same as a content ToC)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/runner/work/calibre/calibre/manual/faq.rst:71
msgid ""
"The newer AZW3 format has proper support for a metadata ToC. However, the "
"Kindle firmware tends to malfunction if you disable the generation of the "
"end-of-file inline ToC. So it is recommended that you leave the generated "
"ToC alone. If you create an AZW3 file with a metadata ToC and no end-of-file"
" generated ToC, some features on the Kindle will not work, such as the Page "
"Flip feature."

"This is caused by a bug in the Amazon software. You can work around it by "

"The bug in Amazon's software is that when you put a MOBI file on a Kindle, "
"unless the file is marked as a Personal document, Amazon assumes you bought "
"the book from it and tries to download the cover thumbnail for it from its "
"servers. When the download fails, it refuses to fallback to the cover "
"defined in the MOBI file. This is likely deliberate on Amazon's part to try "
"to force authors to sell only through them. In other words, the Kindle only "

"If you send a MOBI file to an e-ink Kindle with calibre using a USB "

"Amazon will automatically mark the MOBI file as a Personal Document and the "
