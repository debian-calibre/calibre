"calibre has a highly modular design. Various parts of it can be customized. "
"You can learn how to create *recipes* to add new sources of online content "
"to calibre in the Section :ref:`news`. Here, you will learn, first, how to "
"use environment variables and *tweaks* to customize calibre's behavior,  and"
" then how to specify your own static resources like icons and templates to "
"override the defaults and finally how to use *plugins* to add functionality "
"to calibre."
msgstr "Calibre有高度模块化的设计。它的很多部分可以自定义。您可以学习如何在:ref:`news`里制作*recipes*，来向Calibre中添加网上资源。而在这里，您先要学习如何利用环境变量和*微调*来自定义Calibre的行动，以及如何用您自己的静态资源（比如图标和模板）来取代系统预设的资源。最后，您将了解如何使用*plugins* 来向Calibre中添加功能。"
