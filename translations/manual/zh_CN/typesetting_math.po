"The calibre E-book viewer has the ability to display math embedded in "
"e-books (EPUB and HTML files). You can typeset the math directly with TeX or"
" MathML or AsciiMath. The calibre E-book viewer uses the excellent `MathJax "
"<https://www.mathjax.org>`_ library to do this. This is a brief tutorial on "
"creating e-books with math in them that work well with the calibre E-book "
"viewer."

"You can write mathematics inline inside a simple HTML file and the calibre "
"E-book viewer will render it into properly typeset mathematics. In the "
"example below, we use TeX notation for mathematics. You will see that you "
"can use normal TeX commands, with the small caveat that ampersands and less "
"than and greater than signs have to be written as &amp; &lt; and &gt; "
"respectively."
