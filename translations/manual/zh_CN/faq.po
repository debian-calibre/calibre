"In the MOBI format, the situation is a little confused. This is because the "

"you click Goto Table of Contents on your Kindle, it is to this extra content"
" ToC that the Kindle takes you."
msgstr "在MOBI格式中，情况有点混乱。这是因为MOBI格式，在主流电子书格式中，*没有*对元数据ToC的良好支持。一本MOBI书通过在书的末尾放置一个额外的内容ToC来模拟元数据ToC的存在。当你在Kindle上点击“转到目录”时，Kindle就会把你带到这个额外的ToC内容中。"

"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "

"calibre whether to put it at the start or the end of the book via an option "
"in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "

" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
"the default as it is, i.e. with the metadata ToC at the end of the book. "
"Also note that if you disable the generation of the end-of-file ToC the "

"Author names are complex, especially across cultures, see `this note "

"names.en.php?changelang=en>`_ for some of the complexities. calibre has a "
"very flexible strategy for managing author names. The first thing to "
"understand is that books and authors are separate entities in calibre. A "
"book can have more than one author, and an author can have more than one "
"book. You can manage the authors of a book by the edit metadata dialog. You "
"can manage individual authors by right clicking on the author in the Tag "
"browser on the left of the main calibre window and selecting "
":guilabel:`Manage authors`. Using this dialog you can change the name of an "
"author and also how that name is sorted. This will automatically change the "
"name of the author in all the books of that author. When a book has multiple"
" authors, separate their names using the & character."
