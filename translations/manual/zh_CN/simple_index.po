"You've just started calibre. What do you do now? Before calibre can do "
"anything with your e-books, it first has to know about them. Drag and drop a"
" few e-book files into calibre, or click the \"Add books\" button and browse"
" for the e-books you want to work with. Once you've added the books, they "
"will show up in the main view looking something like this:"

"Once you've admired the list of books you just added to your heart's "
"content, you'll probably want to read one. In order to do that you'll have "
"to convert the book to a format your reader understands. When first running "
"calibre, the Welcome Wizard starts and will set up calibre for your reader "
"device. Conversion is a breeze. Just select the book you want to convert "
"then click the \"Convert books\" button. Ignore all the options for now and "
"click \"OK\". The little icon in the bottom right corner will start "
"spinning. Once it's finished spinning, your converted book is ready. Click "
"the \"View\" button to read the book."
msgstr "一旦你欣赏过刚刚加入你收藏的书单，你可能会想读一本。为了实现这个愿望，您需要将它转换为你阅读器能接受的格式。当您第一次运行 calibre 时，欢迎向导将会启动并为您的阅读设备设置好 calibre。这样就使得转换成为小菜一碟了。选择你想要转换的书籍并点击“转换书籍”按钮。忽略所有选项并点击“OK”。右下部的小图标将会开始旋转。一旦它停止旋转，您转换好的书就已经准备好了。点击“阅读”按钮来阅读这本书吧。"

"If you want to read the book on your reader, connect it to the computer, "
"wait till calibre detects it (10-20 seconds) and then click the \"Send to "
"device\" button. Once the icon stops spinning again, disconnect your reader "
"and read away! If you didn't convert the book in the previous step, calibre "
"will auto convert it to the format your reader device understands."
msgstr "如果你想在你的电子书阅读器上阅读书籍，先将阅读器连接电脑，待Calibre识别你的设备后（约10s-20s），点击“发送到设备”按钮。当按钮图标停止旋转，即可解除设备连接开始阅读。如果你没有在之前的步骤中选择转换书籍格式，Calibre将会自动将书籍转换为你的阅读器可识别的格式。"
