"Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a generic term for access control "
"technologies that can be used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, "
"copyright holders and individuals to try to impose limitations on the usage "
"of digital content and devices. It is also, sometimes, disparagingly "
"described as Digital Restrictions Management. The term is used to describe "
"any technology which inhibits uses (legitimate or otherwise) of digital "
"content that were not desired or foreseen by the content provider. The term "
"generally doesn't refer to other forms of copy protection which can be "
"circumvented without modifying the file or device, such as serial numbers or"
" key-files. It can also refer to restrictions associated with specific "
"instances of digital works or devices. DRM technologies attempt to control "
"use of digital media by preventing access, copying or conversion to other "
"formats by end users. See `Wikipedia "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management>`_."

"数字版权管理 (DRM) 是访问控制技术的通用术语，硬件制造商、出版商、版权所有者和个人可以使用该技术来尝试对数字内容和设备的使用施加限制。 "
"有时，它也被轻蔑地描述为数字限制管理。 该术语用于描述任何禁止使用内容提供商不希望或预见的数字内容（合法或其他方式）的技术。 "
"该术语通常不指无需修改文件或设备即可规避的其他形式的复制保护，例如序列号或密钥文件。 它还可以指与数字作品或设备的特定实例相关的限制。 DRM "
"技术试图通过阻止最终用户访问、复制或转换为其他格式来控制数字媒体的使用。参见`维基百科 "

"When you buy an e-book with DRM you don't really own it but have purchased "
"the permission to use it in a manner dictated to you by the seller. DRM "
"limits what you can do with e-books you have \"bought\". Often people who "
"buy books with DRM are unaware of the extent of these restrictions. These "
"restrictions prevent you from reformatting the e-book to your liking, "
"including making stylistic changes like adjusting the font sizes, although "
"there is software that empowers you to do such things for non DRM books. "
"People are often surprised that an e-book they have bought in a particular "
"format cannot be converted to another format if the e-book has DRM. So if "
"you have an Amazon Kindle and buy a book sold by Barnes and Nobles, you "
"should know that if that e-book has DRM you will not be able to read it on "
"your Kindle. Notice that I am talking about a book you buy, not steal or "
"pirate but BUY."
msgstr ""
"当您购买带有 DRM 的电子书时，您并不真正拥有它，而是购买了按照卖家指定的方式使用它的许可。 DRM 限制了您可以对“购买”的电子书进行的操作。 "
"购买带有 DRM 的书籍的人通常不知道这些限制的程度。 "
"这些限制阻止您根据自己的喜好重新格式化电子书，包括进行风格更改，例如调整字体大小，尽管有软件可以让您对非 DRM 图书执行此类操作。 "
"人们常常感到惊讶的是，他们购买的特定格式的电子书如果具有 DRM，则无法转换为另一种格式。 因此，如果您拥有亚马逊 Kindle 并购买了 Barnes"
" and Nobles 销售的书籍，您应该知道，如果该电子书具有 DRM，您将无法在 Kindle 上阅读。 "
"请注意，我说的是您购买的一本书，不是偷窃或盗版，而是购买。"

"Publishers of DRMed e-books argue that the DRM is all for the sake of "
"authors and to protect their artistic integrity and prevent piracy. But DRM "
"does NOT prevent piracy. People who want to pirate content or use pirated "
"content still do it and succeed. The three major DRM schemes for e-books "
"today are run by Amazon, Adobe and Barnes and Noble and all three DRM "
"schemes have been cracked. All DRM does is inconvenience legitimate users. "
"It can be argued that it actually harms authors as people who would have "
"bought the book choose to find a pirated version as they are not willing to "
"put up with DRM. Those that would pirate in the absence of DRM do so in its "
"presence as well. To reiterate, the key point is that DRM *does not prevent "
"piracy*. So DRM is not only pointless and harmful to buyers of e-books but "
"also a waste of money."
msgstr ""
"DRMed电子书的出版商认为，DRM完全是为了作者的利益，并保护其艺术完整性和防止盗版。 但是DRM不能防止盗版。 "
"想要盗版内容或使用盗版内容的人仍然可以成功。 当今，电子书的三种主要DRM方案由Amazon，Adobe和Barnes and "
"Noble运行，并且所有三种DRM方案都已被破解。 DRM所做的一切只是给合法用户带来不便。 "
"可以说，这实际上损害了作者的利益，因为愿意购买该书的人选择查找盗版，因为他们不愿意忍受DRM。 "
"那些在没有DRM的情况下也会盗版的人在存在DRM的情况下也会这样做。 重申一下，关键是DRM *不能防止盗版*。 "
"因此，DRM不仅毫无意义，对电子书的购买者有害，而且浪费金钱。"

"calibre is open source software while DRM by its very nature is closed. If "
"calibre were to support opening or viewing DRM files it could be trivially "
"modified to be used as a tool for DRM removal which is illegal under today's"

"all about controlling the user, open source software is about empowering the"

"calibre 是开源软件，而 DRM 本质上是封闭的。 如果 calibre 支持打开或查看 DRM 文件，则可以对其进行简单修改以用作 DRM "
