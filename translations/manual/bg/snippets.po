"The calibre editor supports *snippets*. A snippet is a piece of text that is"
" either re-used often or contains a lot of redundant text. The editor allows"
" you to insert a snippet with only a few key strokes. For example, suppose "
"you often find yourself inserting link tags when editing HTML files, then "
"you can simply type ``<a`` in the editor and press |ct|. The editor will "
"expand it to::"

"editor's nifty :ref:`editor_auto_complete` feature. And once you are done "
"typing the filename, press |ct| again and the cursor will jump to the "
"position in between the ``<a>`` tags so you can easily type in the text for "

"The first built-in snippet, and the simplest is used to insert filler text "

"There are a couple of new features here. First the ``$1`` placeholder has "
"become more complex. It now includes some *default text* (the word "
"``filename``). If a placeholder contains default text, the default text is "
"substituted for the placeholder when the snippet is expanded. Also when you "
"jump to a placeholder with default text using |ct|, the default text is "
"selected. In this way, you can use default text to act as a reminder to you "
"to fill in important parts of the template. You can specify default text for"
" a placeholder by using the syntax: ``${<number>:default text}``."

"The other new feature is that the second placeholder has an asterisk after "

"the template is substituted for the placeholder. To see this in action, "
