"Then there is the *metadata ToC*. A metadata ToC is a ToC that is not part "

"reader. For example, in the calibre viewer, you use the Show Table of "
"Contents button to see this ToC. This ToC cannot be styled by the book "
"creator. How it is represented is up to the viewer program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/kovid/work/calibre/manual/faq.rst:60
msgid ""
"In the MOBI format, the situation is a little confused. This is because the "
"MOBI format, alone amongst mainstream e-book formats, *does not* have decent"
" support for a metadata ToC. A MOBI book simulates the presence of a "
"metadata ToC by putting an *extra* content ToC at the end of the book. When "
"you click Goto Table of Contents on your Kindle, it is to this extra content"
" ToC that the Kindle takes you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/kovid/work/calibre/manual/faq.rst:62

"When converting to MOBI, calibre detects the *metadata ToC* in the input "
"document and generates an end-of-file ToC in the output MOBI file. You can "
"turn this off by an option in the MOBI Output settings. You can also tell "
"calibre whether to put it and the start or the end of the book via an option"
" in the MOBI Output settings. Remember this ToC is semantically a *metadata "
"ToC*, in any format other than MOBI it *cannot not be part of the text*. The"
" fact that it is part of the text in MOBI is an accident caused by the "
"limitations of MOBI. If you want a ToC at a particular location in your "
"document text, create one by hand. So we strongly recommend that you leave "
"the default as it is, i.e. with the metadata ToC at the end of the book. "
"Also note that if you disable the generation of the end-of-file ToC the "
"resulting MOBI file may not function correctly on a Kindle, since the "
"Kindle's use the metadata ToC for many things, including the Page Flip "
