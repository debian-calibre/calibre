"regular expressions: *A string by itself is a regular expression that "
"matches itself*. That is to say, if I wanted to match the string ``\"Hello, "

"Next is the beginning of the really good stuff. Remember where I said that "
"regular expressions can match multiple strings? This is were it gets a "
"little more complicated. Say, as a somewhat more practical exercise, the "
"ebook you wanted to convert had a nasty footer counting the pages, like "
"\"Page 5 of 423\". Obviously the page number would rise from 1 to 423, thus "
"you'd have to match 423 different strings, right? Wrong, actually: regular "
"expressions allow you to define sets of characters that are matched: To "
"define a set, you put all the characters you want to be in the set into "
"square brackets. So, for example, the set ``[abc]`` would match either the "
"character \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\". *Sets will always only match one of the "
"characters in the set*. They \"understand\" character ranges, that is, if "
"you wanted to match all the lower case characters, you'd use the set "
"``[a-z]`` for lower- and uppercase characters you'd use ``[a-zA-Z]`` and so "
"on. Got the idea? So, obviously, using the expression ``Page [0-9] of 423`` "
"you'd be able to match the first 9 pages, thus reducing the expressions "
"needed to three: The second expression ``Page [0-9][0-9] of 423`` would "
"match all two-digit page numbers, and I'm sure you can guess what the third "
"expression would look like. Yes, go ahead. Write it down."

"I was hoping you'd say that. But brace yourself, now it gets even better! We"
" just saw that using sets, we could match one of several characters at once."
" But you can even repeat a character or set, reducing the number of "
"expressions needed to handle the above page number example to one. Yes, ONE!"
" Excited? You should be! It works like this: Some so-called special "
"characters, \"+\", \"?\" and \"*\", *repeat the single element preceding "
"them*. (Element means either a single character, a character set, an escape "
"sequence or a group (we'll learn about those last two later)- in short, any "
"single entity in a regular expression.) These characters are called "
"wildcards or quantifiers. To be more precise, \"?\" matches *0 or 1* of the "
"preceding element, \"*\" matches *0 or more* of the preceding element and "
"\"+\" matches *1 or more* of the preceding element. A few examples: The "
"expression ``a?`` would match either \"\" (which is the empty string, not "
"strictly useful in this case) or \"a\", the expression ``a*`` would match "
"\"\", \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row, and, finally, the "
"expression ``a+`` would match \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row "
"(Note: it wouldn't match the empty string!). Same deal for sets: The "
"expression ``[0-9]+`` would match *every integer number there is*! I know "
"what you're thinking, and you're right: If you use that in the above case of"
" matching page numbers, wouldn't that be the single one expression to match "
"all the page numbers? Yes, the expression ``Page [0-9]+ of 423`` would match"
" every page number in that book!"

"A note on these quantifiers: They generally try to match as much text as "
"possible, so be careful when using them. This is called \"greedy "
"behaviour\"- I'm sure you get why. It gets problematic when you, say, try to"
" match a tag. Consider, for example, the string ``\"<p "
"class=\"calibre2\">Title here</p>\"`` and let's say you'd want to match the "
"opening tag (the part between the first pair of angle brackets, a little "
"more on tags later). You'd think that the expression ``<p.*>`` would match "
"that tag, but actually, it matches the whole string! (The character \".\" is"
" another special character. It matches anything *except* linebreaks, so, "
"basically, the expression ``.*`` would match any single line you can think "
"of.) Instead, try using ``<p.*?>`` which makes the quantifier ``\"*\"`` non-"
"greedy. That expression would only match the first opening tag, as intended."
" There's actually another way to accomplish this: The expression "
"``<p[^>]*>`` will match that same opening tag- you'll see why after the next"
" section. Just note that there quite frequently is more than one way to "
"write a regular expression."

"You can of course do that: Just put a backslash in front of any special "

" a tabulator. We'll get to some of the escape sequences later. Oh, and by "

"As a last note on sets, you can also define a set as any character *but* "

"shorthands we saw earlier can also be complemented: ``\"\\D\"`` means any "
"non-number character, thus being equivalent to ``[^0-9]``. The other "
"shorthands can be complemented by, you guessed it, using the respective "

"\"Author\", just as the above example using grouping. *The vertical bar "
"selects between the entire expression preceding and following it*. So, if "
"you wanted to match the strings \"Calibre\" and \"calibre\" and wanted to "
"select only between the upper- and lowercase \"c\", you'd have to use the "
"expression ``(c|C)alibre``, where the grouping ensures that only the \"c\" "
"will be selected. If you were to use ``c|Calibre``, you'd get a match on the"
" string \"c\" or on the string \"Calibre\", which isn't what we wanted. In "
"short: If in doubt, use grouping together with the vertical bar."

"One last word of warning, though: Regexps are powerful, but also really easy"
" to get wrong. calibre provides really great testing possibilities to see if"
" your expressions behave as you expect them to. Use them. Try not to shoot "
"yourself in the foot. (God, I love that expression...) But should you, "
"despite the warning, injure your foot (or any other body parts), try to "
"learn from it."
msgstr "Un ultimo avviso. Nonostante le espressioni regolari sono molto potenti, possono anche essere facilmente fraintese. Calibre fornisce ottime possibilita di test, per vedere se l'espressione regolare funziona come ci si aspetta. Usatele. Cerate di evitare di spararvi in un piede. (Cielo, quanto mi piace questa espressione...). Ma anche se vi doveste ferire un piede (o altri parte anatomiche), nonostante i preavvisi, vede di imparare qualcosa da cio'."
