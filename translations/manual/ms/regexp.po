"Next is the beginning of the really good stuff. Remember where I said that "
"regular expressions can match multiple strings? This is were it gets a "
"little more complicated. Say, as a somewhat more practical exercise, the "
"ebook you wanted to convert had a nasty footer counting the pages, like "
"\"Page 5 of 423\". Obviously the page number would rise from 1 to 423, thus "
"you'd have to match 423 different strings, right? Wrong, actually: regular "
"expressions allow you to define sets of characters that are matched: To "
"define a set, you put all the characters you want to be in the set into "
"square brackets. So, for example, the set ``[abc]`` would match either the "
"character \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\". *Sets will always only match one of the "
"characters in the set*. They \"understand\" character ranges, that is, if "
"you wanted to match all the lower case characters, you'd use the set "
"``[a-z]`` for lower- and uppercase characters you'd use ``[a-zA-Z]`` and so "
"on. Got the idea? So, obviously, using the expression ``Page [0-9] of 423`` "
"you'd be able to match the first 9 pages, thus reducing the expressions "
"needed to three: The second expression ``Page [0-9][0-9] of 423`` would "
"match all two-digit page numbers, and I'm sure you can guess what the third "
"expression would look like. Yes, go ahead. Write it down."

"I was hoping you'd say that. But brace yourself, now it gets even better! We"
" just saw that using sets, we could match one of several characters at once."
" But you can even repeat a character or set, reducing the number of "
"expressions needed to handle the above page number example to one. Yes, ONE!"
" Excited? You should be! It works like this: Some so-called special "
"characters, \"+\", \"?\" and \"*\", *repeat the single element preceding "
"them*. (Element means either a single character, a character set, an escape "
"sequence or a group (we'll learn about those last two later)- in short, any "
"single entity in a regular expression.) These characters are called "
"wildcards or quantifiers. To be more precise, \"?\" matches *0 or 1* of the "
"preceding element, \"*\" matches *0 or more* of the preceding element and "
"\"+\" matches *1 or more* of the preceding element. A few examples: The "
"expression ``a?`` would match either \"\" (which is the empty string, not "
"strictly useful in this case) or \"a\", the expression ``a*`` would match "
"\"\", \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row, and, finally, the "
"expression ``a+`` would match \"a\", \"aa\" or any number of a's in a row "
"(Note: it wouldn't match the empty string!). Same deal for sets: The "
"expression ``[0-9]+`` would match *every integer number there is*! I know "
"what you're thinking, and you're right: If you use that in the above case of"
" matching page numbers, wouldn't that be the single one expression to match "
"all the page numbers? Yes, the expression ``Page [0-9]+ of 423`` would match"
" every page number in that book!"

"A note on these quantifiers: They generally try to match as much text as "
"possible, so be careful when using them. This is called \"greedy "
"behaviour\"- I'm sure you get why. It gets problematic when you, say, try to"
" match a tag. Consider, for example, the string ``\"<p "
"class=\"calibre2\">Title here</p>\"`` and let's say you'd want to match the "
"opening tag (the part between the first pair of angle brackets, a little "
"more on tags later). You'd think that the expression ``<p.*>`` would match "
"that tag, but actually, it matches the whole string! (The character \".\" is"
" another special character. It matches anything *except* linebreaks, so, "
"basically, the expression ``.*`` would match any single line you can think "
"of.) Instead, try using ``<p.*?>`` which makes the quantifier ``\"*\"`` non-"
"greedy. That expression would only match the first opening tag, as intended."
" There's actually another way to accomplish this: The expression "
"``<p[^>]*>`` will match that same opening tag- you'll see why after the next"
" section. Just note that there quite frequently is more than one way to "
"write a regular expression."

"As a last note on sets, you can also define a set as any character *but* "

"shorthands we saw earlier can also be complemented: ``\"\\D\"`` means any "
"non-number character, thus being equivalent to ``[^0-9]``. The other "
"shorthands can be complemented by, you guessed it, using the respective "

"you wanted to match the strings \"Calibre\" and \"calibre\" and wanted to "

"will be selected. If you were to use ``c|Calibre``, you'd get a match on the"
" string \"c\" or on the string \"Calibre\", which isn't what we wanted. In "
"short: If in doubt, use grouping together with the vertical bar."
