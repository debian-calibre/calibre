"E-books come in all shapes and sizes and more often than not, their metadata"
" (things like title/author/series/publisher) is incomplete or incorrect. The"
" simplest way to change metadata in calibre is to simply double click on an "
"entry and type in the correct replacement. For more sophisticated, \"power "
"editing\" use the edit metadata tools discussed below."

"The nicest feature of the edit metadata dialog is its ability to "

"In calibre, a single book entry can have many different *formats* associated"

"Shakespeare in EPUB format and later converted it to MOBI to read on your "
"Kindle. calibre automatically manages multiple formats for you. In the "
":guilabel:`Available formats` section of the Edit metadata dialog, you can "
"manage these formats. You can add a new format, delete an existing format "
"and also ask calibre to set the metadata and cover for the book entry from "
"the metadata in one of the formats."

"First select the books you want to edit by holding Ctrl or Shift and "

"author/publisher/rating/tags/series etc of a bunch of books to the same "
"value. This is particularly useful if you have just imported a number of "
"books that have some metadata in common. This dialog is very powerful, for "

"The :guilabel:`Bulk metadata edit` dialog allows you to perform arbitrarily "

"As noted above, there are two search and replace modes: character match and "
"regular expression. Character match will look in the `Search field` you "
"choose for the characters you type in the `search for` box and replace those"
" characters with what you type in the `replace with` box. Each occurance of "
"the search characters in the field will be replaced. For example, assume the"
" field being searched contains `a bad cat`. If you search for `a` to be "
"replaced with `HELLO`, then the result will be `HELLO bHELLOd cHELLOt`."

"If the field you are searching on is a `multiple` field like tags, then each"

"You can have calibre change the case of the result (information after the "

"The `Your test` box is provided for you to enter text to check that "

"Regular expression mode has some differences from character mode, beyond (of"
" course) using regular expressions. The first is that functions are applied "
"to the parts of the string matched by the search string, not the entire "
"field. The second is that functions apply to the replacement string, not to "
"the entire field."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/kovid/work/calibre/manual/metadata.rst:73
msgid ""
"The third and most important is that the replace string can make reference "
"to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is "
"``\\\\n`` where n is an integer that refers to the n'th parenthesized group "
"in the search expression. For example, given the same example as above, `a "
"bad cat`, a search expression `a (...) (...)`, and a replace expression `a "
"\\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`. Please see the "
":ref:`regexptutorial` for more information on backreferences."

"One useful pattern: assume you want to change the case of an entire field. "
"The easiest way to do this is to use character mode, but lets further assume"
" you want to use regular expression mode. The search expression should be "
"`(.*)` the replace expression should be `\\\\1`, and the desired case change"
" function should be selected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../home/kovid/work/calibre/manual/metadata.rst:77

"Finally, in regular expression mode you can copy values from one field to "
"another. Simply make the source and destination field different. The copy "
"can replace the destination field, prepend to the field (add to the front), "
"or append to the field (add at the end). The 'use comma' checkbox tells "
"calibre to (or not to) add a comma between the text and the destination "
"field in prepend and append modes. If the destination is multiple (e.g., "
"tags), then you cannot uncheck this box."

#: ../../home/kovid/work/calibre/manual/metadata.rst:79
msgid ""
"Search and replace is done after all the other metadata changes in the other"
" tabs are applied. This can lead to some confusion, because the test boxes "
"will show the information before the other changes, but the operation will "
"be applied after the other changes. If you have any doubts about what is "
"going to happen, do not mix search/replace with other changes."
