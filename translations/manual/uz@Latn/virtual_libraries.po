"In calibre, a virtual library is a way to tell calibre to open only a subset of "
"a normal library. For example, you might want to only work with books by a "
"certain author, or books having only a certain tag. Using virtual libraries "
"is the preferred way of partitioning your large book collection into smaller"
" sub collections. It is superior to splitting up your library into multiple "
"smaller libraries as, when you want to search through your entire "
"collection, you can simply go back to the full library. There is no way to "
"search through multiple separate libraries simultaneously in calibre."

"A virtual library is different from a simple search. A search will only "
"restrict the list of books shown in the book list. A virtual library does "
"that, and in addition it also restricts the entries shown in the "
":guilabel:`Tag Browser` to the left. The Tag Browser will only show tags, "
"authors, series, publishers, etc. that come from the books in the virtual "
"library. A virtual library thus behaves as though the actual library "
"contains only the restricted set of books."

"Virtual Libraries are based on *searches*. You can use any search as the "
"basis of a virtual library. The virtual library will contain only the books "
"matched by that search. First, type in the search you want to use in the "
"search bar or build a search using the :guilabel:`Tag Browser`. When you are"
" happy with the returned results, click the Virtual Library button, choose "
"Create Library and enter a name for the new virtual library. The virtual "
"library will then be created based on the search you just typed in. Searches"
" are very powerful, for examples of the kinds of things you can do with "
"them, see :ref:`search_interface`."
