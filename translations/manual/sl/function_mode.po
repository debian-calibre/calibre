"The :guilabel:`Search & replace` tool in the editor support a *function "
"mode*. In this mode, you can combine regular expressions (see :doc:`regexp`)"
" with arbitrarily powerful Python functions to do all sorts of advanced text"
" processing."

msgid ""
"In the standard *regexp* mode for search and replace, you specify both a "
"regular expression to search for as well as a template that is used to "
"replace all found matches. In function mode, instead of using a fixed "
"template, you specify an arbitrary function, in the `Python programming "
"language <https://docs.python.org/2.7/>`_. This allows you to do lots of "
"things that are not possible with simple templates."

"The real power of function mode comes from being able to create your own "

"Every :guilabel:`Search & replace` custom function must have a unique name "

"It represents a match when running a search and replace. Its full "
"documentation in available `here "
"<https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html#match-objects>`_. "
"``match.group()`` simply returns all the matched text and all we do is "

"And it will magically fix all mis-hyphenated words in the text of the book. "
"The main trick is to use one of the useful extra arguments to the replace "
"function, ``dictionaries``.  This refers to the dictionaries the editor "
"itself uses to spell check text in the book. What this function does is look"
" for words separated by a hyphen, remove the hyphen and check if the "
"dictionary recognizes the composite word, if it does, the original words are"
" replaced by the hyphen free composite word."
