"Regular expression mode has some differences from character mode, beyond (of"

"The third and most important is that the replace string can make reference "
"to parts of the search string by using backreferences. A backreference is "
"``\\\\n`` where n is an integer that refers to the n'th parenthesized group "

"bad cat`, a search expression `a (...) (...)`, and a replace expression `a "
"\\\\2 \\\\1`, the result will be `a cat bad`. Please see the "
