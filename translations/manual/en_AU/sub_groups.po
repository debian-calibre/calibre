"Some people wish to organize the books in their library into subgroups, "
"similar to subfolders. The most commonly provided reason is to create genre "
"hierarchies, but there are many others. One user asked for a way to organize"
" textbooks by subject and course number. Another wanted to keep track of "
"gifts by subject and recipient. This tutorial will use the genre example for"
" the rest of this post."

"|sgtree| The calibre hierarchy feature gives you the third -- the ability to"

"By using the hierarchy feature, you can see these genres in the Tag browser "
"in tree form, as shown in the screen image. In this example the outermost "
"level (Genre) is a custom column that contains the genres. Genres containing"
" sub-genres appear with a small triangle next to them. Clicking on that "

"Alternate History will give books in that genre, ignoring those in Military "
"and Space Opera. Of course, a book can have multiple genres. If a book has "

"Another thing you can see from the image is that the genre Military appears "
"twice, once under History and once under Science Fiction. Because the genres"

"Winston Churchill's \"The Second World War\" could be in "

"Fiction.Space Opera.\""

"A hierarchy of 'things' is built by creating an item consisting of phrases "

"\"History.Military\", \"Mysteries.Vampire\", \"Science Fiction.Space "
"Opera\", etc. Thus to create a new genre, you pick a book that should have "
"that genre, edit its metadata, and enter the new genre into the column you "
"created. Continuing our example, if you want to assign a new genre "
"\"Comics\" with a sub-genre \"Superheroes\" to a book, you would 'edit "
"metadata' for that (comic) book, choose the Custom metadata tab, and then "

"The easiest way to search for genres is using the Tag browser, clicking on "
"the genre you wish to see. Clicking on a genre with children will show you "
"books with that genre and all child genres. However, this might bring up a "
"question. Just because a genre has children doesn't mean that it isn't a "
"genre in its own right. For example, a book can have the genre \"History\" "

"\"History\"?"

"The Tag browser search mechanism knows if an item has children. If it does, "

"only (e.g., History). The second is a doubled plus (shown above), which "
"shows you books with that genre and all sub-genres (e.g., History and "
"History.Military). The third is the normal red minus, which shows you books "
"without that exact genre. The fourth is a doubled minus, which shows you "
"books without that genre or sub-genres. The fifth is back to the beginning, "
