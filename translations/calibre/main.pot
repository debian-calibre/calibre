":command:`calibredb` is the command line interface to the calibre database. It has\n"
"several sub-commands, documented below.\n"
"\n"
":command:`calibredb` can be used to manipulate either a calibre database\n"
"specified by path or a calibre :guilabel:`Content server` running either on\n"
"the local machine or over the internet. You can start a calibre\n"
":guilabel:`Content server` using either the :command:`calibre-server`\n"
"program or in the main calibre program click :guilabel:`Connect/share ->\n"
"Start Content server`. Since :command:`calibredb` can make changes to your\n"
"calibre libraries, you must setup authentication on the server first. There\n"
"are two ways to do that:\n"
"\n"
"    * If you plan to connect only to a server running on the same computer,\n"
"      you can simply use the ``--enable-local-write`` option of the\n"
"      Content server, to allow any program, including calibredb, running on\n"
"      the local computer to make changes to your calibre data. When running\n"
"      the server from the main calibre program, this option is in\n"
"      :guilabel:`Preferences->Sharing over the net->Advanced`.\n"
"\n"
"    * If you want to enable access over the internet, then you should setup\n"
"      user accounts on the server and use the :option:`--username` and :option:`--password`\n"
"      options to :command:`calibredb` to give it access. You can setup\n"
"      user authentication for :command:`calibre-server` by using the ``--enable-auth``\n"
"      option and using ``--manage-users`` to create the user accounts.\n"
"      If you are running the server from the main calibre program, use\n"
"      :guilabel:`Preferences->Sharing over the net->Require username/password`.\n"
"\n"
"To connect to a running Content server, pass the URL of the server to the\n"
":option:`--with-library` option, see the documentation of that option for\n"
"details and examples.\n"

"        <p>Here you can add and remove functions used in template processing. A\n"
"        template function is written in Python. It takes information from the\n"
"        book, processes it in some way, then returns a string result. Functions\n"
"        defined here are usable in templates in the same way that builtin\n"
"        functions are usable. The function must be named <b>evaluate</b>, and\n"
"        must have the signature shown below.</p>\n"
"        <p><code>evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, your parameters)\n"
"        &rarr; returning a Unicode string</code></p>\n"
"        <p>The parameters of the evaluate function are:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"        <li><b>formatter</b>: the instance of the formatter being used to\n"
"        evaluate the current template. You can use this to do recursive\n"
"        template evaluation.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>kwargs</b>: a dictionary of metadata. Field values are in this\n"
"        dictionary.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>mi</b>: a <i>Metadata</i> instance. Used to get field information.\n"
"        This parameter can be None in some cases, such as when evaluating\n"
"        non-book templates.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>locals</b>: the local variables assigned to by the current\n"
"        template program.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>your parameters</b>: you must supply one or more formal\n"
"        parameters. The number must match the arg count box, unless arg count is\n"
"        -1 (variable number or arguments), in which case the last argument must\n"
"        be *args. Note that when a function is called in basic template\n"
"        mode at least one argument is always passed. It is\n"
"        supplied by the formatter.</li>\n"
"        </ul></p>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        The following example function checks the value of the field. If the\n"

The case of the suffix is ignored and trailing\nperiods are automatically handled.\n\nThe same is true for author_name_prefixes.\n\nThe author_name_copywords are a set of words which, if they occur in an\nauthor name, cause the automatically generated author sort string to be\nidentical to the author's name. This means that the sort for a string like\n\"Acme Inc.\" will be \"Acme Inc.\" instead of \"Inc., Acme\".\n\nIf author_use_surname_prefixes is enabled, any of the words in\nauthor_surname_prefixes will be treated as a prefix to the surname, if they\noccur before the surname.

A collection derived from a custom field will\nhave the name of the field added to the value. For example, if a custom series\ncolumn named 'My Series' contains the name 'Darkover', then the collection\nwill by default be named 'Darkover (My Series)'. For purposes of this\ndocumentation, 'Darkover' is called the value and 'My Series' is called the\ncategory. If two books have fields that generate the same collection name,\nthen both books will be in that collection.\n\nThis set of tweaks lets you specify for a standard or custom field how\nthe collections are to be named. You can use it to add a description to a\nstandard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also use\nit to force multiple fields to end up in the same collection.\n\nFor example, you could force the values in 'series', '#my_series_1', and\n'#my_series_2' to appear in collections named 'some_value (Series)', thereby\nmerging all of the fields into one set of collections.\n\nThere are two related tweaks.

It uses the\nsame template language as plugboards and save templates. This tweak controls\nhow the value and category are combined together to make the collection name.\nThe only two fields available are {category} and {value}. The {value} field is\nnever empty. The {category} field can be empty. The default is to put the\nvalue first, then the category enclosed in parentheses, it isn't empty:\n'{value} {category:|(|)}'\n\nExamples: The first three examples assume that the second tweak\nhas not been changed.\n\n1) I want three series columns to be merged into one set of collections. The\ncolumn lookup names are 'series', '#series_1' and '#series_2'. I want nothing\nin the parenthesis.

Use:\nsony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}\n\n3) I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection name\nto have '(Series)' appended. The renaming rule is:\nsony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', '#myseries':'Series'}\n\n4) Same as example 2, but instead of having the category name in parentheses\nand appended to the value, I want it prepended and separated by a colon, such\nas in Series: Darkover.

The characters '()' are automatically added to the function name when displayed. For HTML it generates the same as the inline program code text operator (\\`\\`) with no link. Example: ``:ref:`add` `` produces ``add()``. For RST it generates a ``:ref:`` reference that works only in an RST document containing formatter function documentation. Example: ``:ref:`get_note` `` generates \\:ref\\:\\`get_note() <ff_get_note>\\`\n"
"[*][B]Example program code text blocks.[/B] Surround the code block with ``[CODE]`` and ``[/CODE]`` tags. These tags must be first on a line. Example:\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"program:\n"
"    get_note('authors', 'Isaac Asimov', 1)\n"
"[\\/CODE]\n"
"[/CODE]\n"
"produces\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"program:\n"
"    get_note('authors', 'Isaac Asimov', 1)\n"
"[/CODE]\n"
"If you want the literal text ``[/CODE]`` in a code block then it must be entered as ``[\\/CODE]`` to ensure that the FFML parser doesn't interpret it as the end of the code block. The ``'\\'`` character is removed.\n"
"[*][B]Bulleted lists[/B], using BBCODE tags. Surround the list with ``[LIST]`` and ``[/LIST]``. List items are indicated with ``[*]``. All of the tags must be first on a line. Bulleted lists can be nested and can contain other FFML elements.\n"
"\n"
"Example: a two bullet list containing CODE blocks\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"[LIST]\n"
"[*]Return the HTML of the note attached to the tag `Fiction`:\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"program:\n"
"  get_note('tags', 'Fiction', '')\n"
"[\\/CODE]\n"
"[*]Return the plain text of the note attached to the author `Isaac Asimov`:\n"
"[CODE]\n"
"program:\n"
"  get_note('authors', 'Isaac Asimov', 1)\n"
"[\\/CODE]\n"
"[/LIST]\n"
"[/CODE]\n"
"[*][B]End of summary marker[/B]. A summary is generated from the first characters of the documentation. The summary includes text up to a \\[\\/] tag. There is no opening tag because the summary starts at the first character. If there is no \\[\\/] tag then all the document is used for the summary. The \\[\\/] tag is removed, not replaced with white space or any other character.\n"
"[*][B]Escaped character[/B]: precede the character with a backslash. This is useful to escape tags. For example to make the \\[CODE] tag not a tag, use \\\\\\[CODE]. Escaping characters doesn't work in `Inline program code text` or `Example program code text blocks`.\n"
"[/LIST]\n"
"Note: HTML output contains no CSS and does not start with a tag such as <DIV> or <P>."
