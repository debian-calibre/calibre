"        <p>Here you can add and remove functions used in template processing. A\n"
"        template function is written in Python. It takes information from the\n"
"        book, processes it in some way, then returns a string result. Functions\n"
"        defined here are usable in templates in the same way that builtin\n"
"        functions are usable. The function must be named <b>evaluate</b>, and\n"
"        must have the signature shown below.</p>\n"
"        <p><code>evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, your parameters)\n"
"        &rarr; returning a unicode string</code></p>\n"
"        <p>The parameters of the evaluate function are:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"        <li><b>formatter</b>: the instance of the formatter being used to\n"
"        evaluate the current template. You can use this to do recursive\n"
"        template evaluation.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>kwargs</b>: a dictionary of metadata. Field values are in this\n"
"        dictionary.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>mi</b>: a <i>Metadata</i> instance. Used to get field information.\n"
"        This parameter can be None in some cases, such as when evaluating\n"
"        non-book templates.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>locals</b>: the local variables assigned to by the current\n"
"        template program.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>your parameters</b>: you must supply one or more formal\n"
"        parameters. The number must match the arg count box, unless arg count is\n"
"        -1 (variable number or arguments), in which case the last argument must\n"
"        be *args. At least one argument is required, and is usually the value of\n"
"        the field being operated upon. Note that when writing in basic template\n"
"        mode, the user does not provide this first argument. Instead it is\n"
"        supplied by the formatter.</li>\n"
"        </ul></p>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        The following example function checks the value of the field. If the\n"
"        field is not empty, the field's value is returned, otherwise the value\n"
"        EMPTY is returned.\n"
"        <pre>\n"
"        name: my_ifempty\n"
"        arg count: 1\n"
"        doc: my_ifempty(val) -- return val if it is not empty, otherwise the string 'EMPTY'\n"

A collection derived from a custom field will\nhave the name of the field added to the value. For example, if a custom series\ncolumn named 'My Series' contains the name 'Darkover', then the collection\nwill by default be named 'Darkover (My Series)'. For purposes of this\ndocumentation, 'Darkover' is called the value and 'My Series' is called the\ncategory. If two books have fields that generate the same collection name,\nthen both books will be in that collection.\nThis set of tweaks lets you specify for a standard or custom field how\nthe collections are to be named. You can use it to add a description to a\nstandard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also use\nit to force multiple fields to end up in the same collection. For example, you\ncould force the values in 'series', '#my_series_1', and '#my_series_2' to\nappear in collections named 'some_value (Series)', thereby merging all of the\nfields into one set of collections.\nThere are two related tweaks.
