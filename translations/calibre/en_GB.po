A ligature is a special rendering of a pair of characters like ff, fi, fl, etc. Most readers do not have support for ligatures in their default fonts, so they are unlikely to render correctly. By default, calibre will turn a ligature into the corresponding pair of normal characters. This option will preserve them instead."

"        defined here are usable in templates in the same way that builtin\n"
"        functions are usable. The function must be named <b>evaluate</b>, and\n"
"        must have the signature shown below.</p>\n"
"        <p><code>evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, your parameters)\n"

"        <li><b>kwargs</b>: a dictionary of metadata. Field values are in this\n"
"        dictionary.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>mi</b>: a <i>Metadata</i> instance. Used to get field information.\n"
"        This parameter can be None in some cases, such as when evaluating\n"
"        non-book templates.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>locals</b>: the local variables assigned to by the current\n"
"        template program.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>your parameters</b>: you must supply one or more formal\n"
"        parameters. The number must match the arg count box, unless arg count is\n"
"        -1 (variable number or arguments), in which case the last argument must\n"
"        be *args. At least one argument is required, and is usually the value of\n"
"        the field being operated upon. Note that when writing in basic template\n"
"        mode, the user does not provide this first argument. Instead it is\n"
"        supplied by the formatter.</li>\n"
"        </ul></p>\n"
