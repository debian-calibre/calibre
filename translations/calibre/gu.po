"      user accounts on the server and use the :option:`--username` and :option:`--password`\n"

"      user authentication for :command:`calibre-server` by using the ``--enable-auth``\n"

"        <p>Here you can add and remove functions used in template processing. A\n"
"        template function is written in Python. It takes information from the\n"
"        book, processes it in some way, then returns a string result. Functions\n"
"        defined here are usable in templates in the same way that builtin\n"
"        functions are usable. The function must be named <b>evaluate</b>, and\n"
"        must have the signature shown below.</p>\n"
"        <p><code>evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, your parameters)\n"
"        &rarr; returning a Unicode string</code></p>\n"
"        <p>The parameters of the evaluate function are:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"        <li><b>formatter</b>: the instance of the formatter being used to\n"
"        evaluate the current template. You can use this to do recursive\n"
"        template evaluation.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>kwargs</b>: a dictionary of metadata. Field values are in this\n"
"        dictionary.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>mi</b>: a <i>Metadata</i> instance. Used to get field information.\n"
"        This parameter can be None in some cases, such as when evaluating\n"
"        non-book templates.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>locals</b>: the local variables assigned to by the current\n"
"        template program.</li>\n"
"        <li><b>your parameters</b>: you must supply one or more formal\n"
"        parameters. The number must match the arg count box, unless arg count is\n"
"        -1 (variable number or arguments), in which case the last argument must\n"
"        be *args. At least one argument is required, and is usually the value of\n"
"        the field being operated upon. Note that when writing in basic template\n"
"        mode, the user does not provide this first argument. Instead it is\n"
"        supplied by the formatter.</li>\n"
"        </ul></p>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        The following example function checks the value of the field. If the\n"
"        field is not empty, the field's value is returned, otherwise the value\n"
"        EMPTY is returned.\n"
"        <pre>\n"
"        name: my_ifempty\n"
"        arg count: 1\n"
"        doc: my_ifempty(val) -- return val if it is not empty, otherwise the string 'EMPTY'\n"
"        program code:\n"
"        def evaluate(self, formatter, kwargs, mi, locals, val):\n"
"            if val:\n"
"                return val\n"
"            else:\n"
"                return 'EMPTY'</pre>\n"
"        This function can be called in any of the three template program modes:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"        <li>single-function mode: {tags:my_ifempty()}</li>\n"
"        <li>template program mode: {tags:'my_ifempty($)'}</li>\n"

"{'field_lookup_name':'category_name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}\n"

"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', '#series_2':''}\n"
"2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from series, and\n"
"the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}\n"
"3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection name\n"
