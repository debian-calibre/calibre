"{'field_lookup_name':'category_name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}\n"

"'{value} {category:|(|)}'\n"

"1: I want three series columns to be merged into one set of collections. The\n"

"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', '#series_2':''}\n"
"2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from series, and\n"
"the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}\n"
"3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection name\n"
