"calibre has a conversion system that is designed to be very easy to use. "
"Normally, you just add a book to calibre, click convert and calibre will try"
" hard to generate output that is as close as possible to the input. However,"
" calibre accepts a very large number of input formats, not all of which are "
"as suitable as others for conversion to e-books. In the case of such input "
"formats, or if you just want greater control over the conversion system, "
"calibre has a lot of options to fine tune the conversion process. Note "
"however that calibre's conversion system is not a substitute for a full "
"blown e-book editor. To edit e-books, I recommend first converting them to "
"EPUB or AZW3 using calibre and then using the :guilabel:`Edit book` feature "
"to get them into perfect shape. You can then use the edited e-book as input "
"for conversion into other formats in calibre."
msgstr "캘리버는 매우 사용하기 쉽도록 설계된 변환 시스템을 가지고 있습니다. 보통은, 사용자가 캘리버에 책을 추가하고 변환을 클릭하기만 하면, 입력된 책에 가장 가까운 결과물을 만들기 위하여 캘리버가 최선을 다하게 됩니다. 하지만, 캘리버가 지원하는 매우 다양한 종류의 입력 형식들이 모두 전자책 변환에 적합한 것은 아닙니다. 만일 입력 형식이 이러한 경우이거나 또는 사용자가 변환 시스템에 더 많은 제어를 원하는 경우, 캘리버에는 변환 과정을 세부적으로 조정할 수 있는 아주 많은 옵션들이 있습니다. 하지만, 캘리버의 변환 시스템이 전용 전자책 편집기를 대체할 수 없다는 점은 항상 명심하시기 바랍니다. 전자책을 편집하는 방법으로는, 우선 캘리버를 사용하여 책을 EPUB이나 AZW3 형식으로 변환한 뒤, :guilabel:`책 편집` 특정 기능을 사용하여 완벽한 형태로 다듬는 것을 추천합니다. 그런 다음 편집이 완료된 전자책을 입력으로 사용하여 캘리버에서 다른 형식들로 변환할 수 있습니다."

"The transforms that act on the XHTML output are where all the work happens. "
"There are various transforms, for example, to insert book metadata as a page"

"It is important to remember that all the transforms act on the XHTML output "

" tells calibre how many \"steps\" bigger or smaller a given font size should"
" be compared to the base font size. The idea is that there should be a "
"limited number of font sizes in a document. For example, one size for the "
"body text, a couple of sizes for different levels of headings and a couple "
