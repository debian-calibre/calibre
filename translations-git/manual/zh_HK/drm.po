"Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a generic term for access control "
"technologies that can be used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, "
"copyright holders and individuals to try to impose limitations on the usage "
"of digital content and devices. It is also, sometimes, disparagingly "
"described as Digital Restrictions Management. The term is used to describe "
"any technology which inhibits uses (legitimate or otherwise) of digital "
"content that were not desired or foreseen by the content provider. The term "
"generally doesn't refer to other forms of copy protection which can be "
"circumvented without modifying the file or device, such as serial numbers or"
" key-files. It can also refer to restrictions associated with specific "
"instances of digital works or devices. DRM technologies attempt to control "
"use of digital media by preventing access, copying or conversion to other "
"formats by end users. See `Wikipedia "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management>`_."

"When you buy an e-book with DRM you don't really own it but have purchased "
"the permission to use it in a manner dictated to you by the seller. DRM "
"limits what you can do with e-books you have \"bought\". Often people who "
"buy books with DRM are unaware of the extent of these restrictions. These "
"restrictions prevent you from reformatting the e-book to your liking, "
"including making stylistic changes like adjusting the font sizes, although "
"there is software that empowers you to do such things for non DRM books. "
"People are often surprised that an e-book they have bought in a particular "
"format cannot be converted to another format if the e-book has DRM. So if "
"you have an Amazon Kindle and buy a book sold by Barnes and Nobles, you "
"should know that if that e-book has DRM you will not be able to read it on "
"your Kindle. Notice that I am talking about a book you buy, not steal or "
"pirate but BUY."

"当您购买具有DRM的电子书时，您并不是真正的拥有者，而是已经购买了以卖方指定的方式使用它的许可。 DRM限制了您对“购买”的电子书的处理能力。 "
"通常，使用DRM购买书籍的人并不了解这些限制的程度。 "
"这些限制使您无法按自己的喜好重新设置电子书的格式，包括进行样式更改（如调整字体大小），尽管有些软件可以使您对非DRM图书执行此类操作。 "
"人们通常会惊讶地发现，如果购买的电子书具有DRM，则无法将其购买的特定格式的电子书转换为另一种格式。 因此，如果您拥有Amazon "
"Kindle并购买了Barnes and Nobles出售的书，那么您应该知道，如果该电子书具有DRM，您将无法在Kindle上阅读。 "
"请注意，我说的是您购买的书，不是偷书或盗版，而是买书。"

msgid ""
"Publishers of DRMed e-books argue that the DRM is all for the sake of "
"authors and to protect their artistic integrity and prevent piracy. But DRM "
"does NOT prevent piracy. People who want to pirate content or use pirated "
"content still do it and succeed. The three major DRM schemes for e-books "
"today are run by Amazon, Adobe and Barnes and Noble and all three DRM "
"schemes have been cracked. All DRM does is inconvenience legitimate users. "
"It can be argued that it actually harms authors as people who would have "
"bought the book choose to find a pirated version as they are not willing to "
"put up with DRM. Those that would pirate in the absence of DRM do so in its "
"presence as well. To reiterate, the key point is that DRM *does not prevent "
"piracy*. So DRM is not only pointless and harmful to buyers of e-books but "
"also a waste of money."
msgstr ""
"DRMed电子书的出版商认为，DRM完全是为了作者的利益，并保护其艺术完整性和防止盗版。 但是DRM不能防止盗版。 "
"想要盗版内容或使用盗版内容的人仍然可以成功。 当今，电子书的三种主要DRM方案由Amazon，Adobe和Barnes and "
"Noble运行，并且所有三种DRM方案都已被破解。 DRM所做的一切只是给合法用户带来不便。 "
"可以说，这实际上损害了作者的利益，因为愿意购买该书的人选择查找盗版，因为他们不愿意忍受DRM。 "
"那些在没有DRM的情况下也会盗版的人在存在DRM的情况下也会这样做。 重申一下，关键是DRM *不能防止盗版*。 "
"因此，DRM不仅毫无意义，对电子书的购买者有害，而且浪费金钱。"

"calibre is open source software while DRM by its very nature is closed. If "
"calibre were to support opening or viewing DRM files it could be trivially "
"modified to be used as a tool for DRM removal which is illegal under today's"
" laws. Open source software and DRM are a clash of principles. While DRM is "
"all about controlling the user, open source software is about empowering the"
" user. The two simply can not coexist."

"calibre 一個開放原始碼的軟體，而 DRM 本身的特性是非常封閉的。如果 calibre 支援開啟或檢視 DRM "

"的一切就是在控制使用者，而開源軟體的一切則是給予使用者自主權。兩者是無法共存的"

"As somebody who reads and buys e-books you can help fight DRM. Do not buy "
"e-books with DRM. There are some publishers who publish DRM-free e-books. "
"Make an effort to see if they carry the e-book you are looking for. If you "
"like books by certain independent authors that sell DRM-free e-books and you"
" can afford it make donations to them. This is money well spent as their "
"e-books tend to be cheaper (there may be exceptions) than the ones you would"
" buy from publishers of DRMed books and would probably work on all devices "
"you own in the future saving you the cost of buying the e-book again. Do not"
" discourage publishers and authors of DRM-free e-books by pirating their "
"content. Content providers deserve compensation for their efforts. Do not "
"punish them for trying to make your reading experience better by making "
"available DRM-free e-books. In the long run this is detrimental to you.  If "
"you have bought books from sellers that carry both DRMed as well as DRM-free"
" books, not knowing if they carry DRM or not make it a point to leave a "
"comment or review on the website informing future buyers of its DRM status. "

"只要有人閱讀或者是購買電子書就可以協助對抗 DRM，不要購買有 DRM 的電子書。有些出版社會出版無 DRM "
"的電子書。努力看看它們是否有你正在尋找的電子書。如果你喜歡的書是由某些的販售無 DRM "
"的獨立出版者所出版的電子書、而且你負擔的起了話，那就贊助他們。這些錢可以幫助它們把價格訂得比有 DRM 的出版社還更低廉 "
"（還是有例外），而且未來八成可以在你所擁有的任何裝置上閱讀，還可以避免再花一次錢買同本書。不要以盜版來挫敗無 DRM "
"的出版社和作者。內容提供者有他付出血汗應有的報酬。不要把自己為了閱讀體驗更佳所製作的無 DRM 電子書公開出去。長期來說這是對你有害的。 "
"如果你曾經從有無 DRM 皆售的銷售者那邊買了書，但是卻不知道是否有 DRM，請堅持在網頁上留下留言或是評價提醒未來的買家書本的 DRM "
